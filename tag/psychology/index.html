part</a> of the self-diagnosing system. Normally, you connect it to the decision-making unit and pass data to it. If that unit doesn't use this data, some will call it an intellectualization. It's like a defense, but the symptoms aren't specific. The causes can be different.</p><p>First situation. Your system works fine, but your resources are limited. You need to be efficient. In this case, you may play with priorities and mark some data as not important.</p><p>This is what they teach you to do in traditional martial arts. You're aware of your status, but you don't use that data to make decisions at the moment. Good news or bad ones. It doesn't matter. Keep the balance. You need intelligence here.</p><p>Second situation. You got an overamplified signal in the system. It can easily fry your decision-making unit. Your fuses stop it automatically. No intelligence. Just a fuse.</p><p>You lose all data from some part of your system. It's not because you created a logical rule to ignore it, but because your safety system got triggered. Your data can still be there, but you can't get to it until your fuses reset. You may measure tension in the system and feel isolated in some sense.</p><p>Third situation. Your system lost energy. This is what we expect to see in schizophrenia, when the completely opposite processes annihilate each other and constantly waste energy.</p><p>You have to cut power in some places. Self-monitoring system is optional, so you can safely shut it down and keep the main system running. Your fuses are intact. You don't have any rules to ignore data. You just don't have any data for now.</p><p>Interestingly enough, sick people, who understand that some system doesn't work and adapt their rules in advance, can be suspiciously stable in catastrophic environments. Everybody around is getting overloaded and confused and they don't.</p><p>Also, there is a fourth scenario, where the physical damage to data channels prevents you from using information. It's a whole new level of problems, but it gives us similar results.</p><p>These situations look almost identical from the outside. You use your upper brain and you don't get unbalanced by data of the specific type. It's easy to accidentally see them as one.</p><p>Next time you blame somebody for being not emotional enough, pay attention to details. Not every person is identical, and the most popular second scenario for intellectualization doesn't require intelligence at all. Keep that in mind.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-ghost-within">The ghost within</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;07</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-459279" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-459279)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/89e782e408643e919b39a28cb78805eb.jpg" alt="The ghost within" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The concept of inner child is one of the mysteries of psychology. It's there, but you can't measure it. It affects you, but maybe not. You can interact with it, but not shoot it dead. It's not a child, but a ghost of a child.</p><p>From our perspective, there is only one object that fits the profile. A part of the memory graph that was constructed relatively long ago and includes at least one rule.</p><p>The main problem here is that the rule itself and the data that was a reason to create it are two separate things. If you delete the rule and keep the data, it's not a problem, but if you lose the data, but keep the rule, then you get yourself a ghost rule. A rule with no reason to be there.</p><p>People who use the same patterns of behavior for their whole lives may never think about these things. You ain't need no inner child to be a man! It's because all their rules point them more or less in the same direction.</p><p>Some people may want to switch to another pattern. It's not a problem, but you need to update the rules. Some of them are universal. Language. Basic skills. Profession. But some rules may be connected to a specific pattern that you've used before. It's time to delete them.</p><p>But if some rule doesn't have a reason to exist anymore, it would be hard to evaluate how important the rule is. For some it will feel safer to keep it intact. This is the way to get stuck between patterns, not using your full potential with the new ones.</p><p>Usually, the concept of inner child comes into play in relation to <a href="/post/trauma">trauma</a>, but it looks like the trauma is a special case. Old rules exist in your memory regardless of your patterns. Clients in therapy will never cover the whole variety of possible behaviors, but it should be obvious that one becomes a prey only because there are predators out there. They may have rules, not related to traumas, but the same conflict inside.</p><p>The most popular way to deal with ghosts from the past in folklore is giving them what they want. Apparently, this is the technique of choice for many therapists these days. Take your inner child and fulfill his needs. No, it's not magic!</p><p>It kind of works. But you have to be careful. Your goal is to destroy what's left of the old pattern. Not to encourage it. Be not afraid to burn things. There is no such thing as "true self" to lose here. There are old rules and new rules. If you got two incompatible rules, you just choose one and stick with it. This is who you are. For now. One day you'll become a ghost yourself and will haunt the future you.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/updating-memory">Updating memory</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-703225" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-703225)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/c7eb0a18085976d703464bcf41aa5cb0.jpg" alt="Updating memory" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>What happens when you update data in your memory? It's a complex process. It takes some time, and there are distinct stages in it that can be important for us. Let's take a look.</p><p>First. You got a new piece of data. It's in your system, but it's not yet connected to anything in the main graph of memories. Updates in the real world are not instant. There is some lag to expect. In many cases you have to proceed with your tasks with slightly outdated information. Psychologists will call this "denial". You have data, but you don't use it.</p><p>Second. The process of updating has started. Now you have conflicts in memory. Some new connections were added. Some old data is still there. It's a mess. Usually, in computer systems, we avoid any actions at this stage. Operations with partially updated memory tend to destabilize everything. It's safer to stop and wait. In terms of psychologists, it's like a state of "bargaining". There are potential conflicts inside.</p><p>Third, the process finished. Your memory is up-to-date. You're good to go. This is what you would probably call "acceptance".</p><p>These three stages of the process are absolutely inevitable. Every heartless machine has them. But your system, depending on its design, may or may not have additional signals for self-diagnosing and internal synchronization.</p><p>Before the first stage, you may get a signal from your inputs that the update is required. It's a kick-starter. A flash. It doesn't last long. We may call this a "surprise", "shock", or whatever word feels more suitable for the circumstances.</p><p>Before the second stage, you already have the data, and you may evaluate the resources required for the update and further actions. At this point you may get a bunch of signals all over the system that order the parts of it to redirect energy. A lot of things happen simultaneously. Priorities change. Some subsystems lose resources. We may call this "frustration".</p><p>Before the third stage, you may diagnose the system again to see how much resources you've spent and what's left. You may need this data to plan your further survival. In human terms it's either "relief", or "tiredness", or something like that.</p><p>Psychologists often describe the stages of grief in a similar fashion. The main issue is that they tell you what we see, but not what happens. In the result, you can get various poetic word plays that are very hard to test. But when you look from the inside, you see the inevitable parts of the process. And they're not about your feelings, really. Every one of them has a purely engineering reason to be there.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/compensation">Compensation</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-762849" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-762849)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/b9c9cec640bef57eab2f394c20259849.jpg" alt="Compensation" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Life is a game of incomplete information. We make decisions using the data we have. We approximate our future all the time. And this process heavily depends on our knowledge.</p><p>In math, it's highly unlikely that you'll guess the curve looking at one point. Even two of three points will leave you clueless. With ten points your guesses become more precise. You still can fail spectacularly, even with hundreds of them, but more points increase the chances of making the right guess.</p><p>The same happens in life. You imagine something using a limited set of data. Then you learn more and realize your... It's not a mistake. No. Let's call it "unlucky guess". You can miss just a bit, or get something completely opposite to reality.</p><p>You're intelligent. Any guess, any choice, leads to the creation of new rules. You continue to add more data to the graph of memories using these rules. Your whole personality shifts somewhere. It's our nature. We constantly change.</p><p>If some choice affects a lot of things in your life, the accidental shift can be dramatic. Some would see it as a compensation. Like you got a small problem and decided to run from it in the opposite direction. However, I would argue that this is not a defense. It's just a premature guess that leads to unplanned big changes. A butterfly effect, if you will.</p><p>Psychologists often talk about healthy and unhealthy compensations. This evaluation relies on the environment and collective morality, but everything <a href="/post/relative-irrationality">is relative</a>. Prey could easily say that predatory behavior is a bad compensation for some insecurities. Don't forget that our closest cousins in the wilderness eat raw meat. We were never designed to be wimps by default. Different patterns of behavior have reasons to exist, even if they look bad to your eyes. Biology and subjective morality are not the same. Don't rush your verdicts about the healthiness of changes.</p><p>Personality shifts are harmless on their own. However, dissonances in data are expected to appear when you learn more things after a big turn. Your brain will have to fix them, remove some rules and tune some numbers to compensate for over or under estimations. It takes time, but it's a <a href="/post/make-it-black">natural process</a> of data invalidation. Nothing to worry about.</p><p>But if you get a disease that allows contradicting patterns of behavior to appear, any shift may become a problem.

It's a very straightforward action on its own, but it feels like there is one nuance that needs to be elaborated.</p><p>Every pattern of behavior of class I includes impulses from three systems out of four. One is missing. When we're trying to stop some loop, it doesn't make much sense to appeal to something that is not connected to it.</p><p>For example, patterns (1), (5), (9), (13). The first column of our table. They don't utilize intelligence. Individuals will not react to any logical reasoning. They won't stop just because you have good arguments. They may react to the changes in the environment, new temptations, or something that affects their will to live. But serious discussions are a waste of time.</p><p>Chimp, turning aggressive because all females ignore him (1), can change his mind when he gets attention. Gladiator (5) may stop if he loses feedback. Don't feed the troll! You can even unbalance highly adaptive ones (9) by taking their ability to ignore things. You can change the environment, play with choices against something, or even use blind force, but have you ever tried to reason with any of these characters? It's hard. It just doesn't work. It's the wrong tool for the job.</p><p>The loops in the second column, (2), (6), (10), (14), don't utilize free will. If you tell these individuals that they can just try something new, they'll not listen. They're not ready to explore possibilities and make big decisions on their own. Adapt. They use their brains. You can make an argument. Just don't suggest them jump off the cliff right from the beginning. Start small.</p><p>The third column, (3), (7), (11), (15), is not connected to will to live. These ones will not care about the risks in the long run. The last column, (4), (8), (12), (16), is not connected to the environment. You'll not stop these loops by changing external circumstances. Every column has one thing that is not there. Interact with the others.</p><p>To guide behavior, we stop one pattern and help to use another one. All these thoughts can be applied to it as well. Don't waste resources on supporting something that's not connected to the desired pattern. Be efficient. Concentrate on one thing and push it to the end.</p><p>In many approaches in psychology, one trick is being used for everything. But this is not the case. Every column has its unique features. Every pattern is different. You have to be intentional and precise. The table can be used as a cheat sheet. It should help.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/make-a-choice">Make a choice</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;02</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-375044" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-375044)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/eadeb6a6576911c25b0316240b0ff113.jpg" alt="Make a choice" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>We portray our pagan ancestors in folklore as free and prideful men, standing against nature itself and playing with forces far beyond their control. They never kneel. They would better die fighting, rather than accept and obey. They value creativity. They're playing against all odds. They constantly transform themselves and the world. This path of change is dangerous. They pay with blood. But they are free.</p><p>In this context, we may treat freedom and change as almost equivalent things. You don't break free when you choose between the provided options and then argue about things that you could have done otherwise. You need to change the rules of the game. Create a new option that was never given to you. Don't choose the future. Make it. Burn the past and rise from the ashes like a phoenix. Become a new man. Build a new tomorrow.</p><p>These choices may look very personal, because you may associate yourself with your memory, and data from it is being used, but they have to include some things that can't come from the same memory. You need a mutation to happen in your data.</p><p>Depending on how you see yourself, the choices may look truly yours, or not. Many philosophers are flying in circles around the definition of "you" in this equation. As far as I can see, the answer depends on religions and historically affected cultural environments. But regardless of determinism, indeterminism, immaterial souls, or whatever stories you like, the problem reduces to memory and mutations in it.</p><p>If you aim to change your life, you have to let go. Both your past memories and active control. Get all your demons together and cut them loose. Allow chaos to provide you alternative options. Take one that is more or less aligned with the data in your mindset and use it. Just because you can.</p><p>Losing control? It's dangerous! No. No. No. Your will to live goes against your will to freedom. It's stupid. It's anarchy. It's inappropriate. Destroy stability? Take risks? Change everything? Seriously? Don't know what kind of witch made you think that it's a good idea, but we have to get rid of her. Your self-preservation mechanism protects you from changes.</p><p>On the level of societies, we see the same picture. Will to live is being constructed in the form of police, courts, prisons, censorship, etc. It protects the existence of society. But the price is freedom.</p><p>These days many people see freedom not in changes, not in rebellions, but in choosing which TV channel to watch. Some even say they don't have a choice. Maybe you need to remind yourself that you don't choose a choice.</p><p>You make a choice.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/trauma">Trauma</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;29</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-233353" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-233353)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/210bb57f855dd5637bd941f570bad0a0.jpg" alt="Trauma" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Psychologists like the word "trauma". But the definitions are very vague. Maybe we should take a look at the potential problems and help this term mean something more specific.</p><p>First. <a href="/post/make-it-black">Cognitive dissonance</a>. I would argue that it's not a trauma at all. It's a natural process. Nothing is broken. You just need to grab a coffee and wait for your memory to update the data. It's a temporary inconvenience.</p><p>Second. Diseases. Mania. Depression. Catatonia. Schizophrenia. They lead us to internal logical conflicts. There are serious <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">breakdowns in the system</a>. The same applies to anxiety with exaggerated impulses and other diseases. You can't fix rusty valves and leaking tubes by talking about your childhood. I mean, you can ignore the leak, but it's not a real solution.</p><p>Third. Memory about the dangerous environment that pushes you into the patterns (9) or (15). Adapt and ignore, or justify and call for pity. Or both, as a pattern of the class II. This is what I prefer to classify as trauma. It's not just memory. It affects your behavior. And it's not a disease.</p><p>These two patterns are natural ways to behave for prey animals, but some educated and emotional people may not agree. High levels of stress hormones. You miss something. Grass is greener on the other side. You know the drill. But this problem can be solved. You can switch to other patterns. The real danger is in running from a bear through a minefield.</p><p>Let's say you are an adaptive victim (9) + (15). Danger is everywhere. You work on self-awareness and you convince yourself that everything is safe now. Welcome to the pair (10) + (15). Helpless victim. Now you have dread on top of your trauma. Oops. And this pattern is a very confusing one. It's not a broken switch of depression, but an odd combination of danger and safety in an ocean of tears. Not the best choice.</p><p>Maybe, you're a real man. You decide to stop crying. Then you can slip into (9) + (16). Adaptive conformist. Same problem with dread. Your stress hormones won't get lower. Wait. What?</p><p>You can be stuck in this maze for a while, actually. Our chemistry is very inert. It will help you to switch between these patterns back and forth. It's hard to find an exit. Plus, in terms of energy, it's efficient to stick to one pattern. Changes of directions can exhaust you on their own.</p><p>If you want to get out, you need to choose the patterns (11), (12), (13), or (14), or change the side completely and become a proactive predator. Their patterns are based on a different chemistry. But this choice is not for everyone.

Are they even connected? And, if yes, then how?</p><p>These sorts of data mappings are useful in practice, but I think we have to be careful. All these traits don't define you. They describe you. There is a difference. We assign the words to different observable qualities, but they don't necessarily explain the internal structure of the organism. I will propose a classification that can be used with my theory, but again, it's all about semantics and language.</p><p>The first group of traits comes directly from our 16 patterns of behavior of the class I. When you use the same pattern over a long period of time, people start to associate its parts with you. Creative. Aggressive. Dramatic. These kinds of words describe what you do. They portray your patterns of behavior and should be bound together by the same logic as the basic impulses. We easily apply these words to little kids and our pet animals, since the patterns are universal.</p><p>The second group is about your stability and efficiency. Cool-headed. Purposeful. Committed. Emotional. All over the place. These words don't describe any specific patterns, but provide data on your ability to actually finish whatever you do. Get the job done and not waste the resources. These qualities are very important in competitive environments, where the resources are limited. They're often mentioned in traditional martial arts as something crucial for survival and deeply interconnected with a state of a body. There are some correlations to study in their context.</p><p>The third group includes the rules-based qualities. Idealistic. Principled. Methodical. Pedantic. In some cases they affect your efficiency, in some cases they don't, but what makes them special is that you need to be intelligent and create a lot of rules in your memory to get these traits associated with you. Cultural environment. Education. Previous experience. More rules you learn, more variety you get here. Usually we treat little kids and animals as intellectually inferior creatures and do not apply these words to them in any form.</p><p>The fourth group includes the traits based on your connections with others. They don't describe you in vacuum, but rather add some data on the alignment of your behavior with a group. Selfless. Selfish. Reliable. Unreliable. Cooperative. Uncooperative. These words naturally come in pairs, and they're relative by definition. We're talking about combinations of compatible and incompatible patterns and rules that meet each other for various reasons and do not depend exclusively on your own personality. If you have multiple groups to interact with, then it's very possible that they'll associate the exact opposite traits of this kind with you. And usually we don't apply these words to animals, unless they're seriously involved in our group activities, like hunting dogs.</p><p>What do you do? How stable are you? Any special rules? Answers to these questions describe your overall personality. I'm not sure if we should treat the fourth group of words as personality traits, but they can add more details to the description. Context can be important sometimes.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/relative-irrationality">Relative irrationality</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;22</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-776275" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-776275)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/49eb322fd06dd97d5a9eb8c8f9a81d3f.jpg" alt="Relative irrationality" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Irrational. I avoided this word for a while. It's way too confusing. With a dream to build a replicant that will mimic human behavior, I'm looking for engineering explanations for everything, but irrational thinking is something odd. What is it? How do you build it? Nobody has any blueprints of it. I started to scroll through examples of irrational thoughts and actions with a hope to find some patterns in this mess on my own...</p><p>Constant fear of safety. Perceiving every environment as dangerous. Choices to not do anything and procrastination. Consuming instead of creating. Ignoring. Crying for help when not needed... Wait. No. This looks like the processes on the reactive side of the table. These are patterns of behavior of the prey animals. They don't make any sense for a predator.</p><p>Eventually I got some reversed examples, where the predatory behavior was claimed to be irrational from the perspective of the prey. That's an interesting duality of opinions. Almost like we have two opposing kinds of reasoning, and everybody believes that his reasoning is the rational one.</p><p>It looks like this whole thing is not about you choosing emotions over brains, but about somebody wanting you to be a predator, while you're not one of them, or vice versa.</p><p>This means that the term "irrational" is relative, actually. You're always rational in relation to your own patterns of behavior, but at the same time you can be irrational in relation to the patterns on the other side. In many ways it's like a <a href="/post/scattered-morality">personal morality</a>. It's not universal by definition.</p><p>In mania, depression, catatonia, and schizophrenia, we see combinations of contradicting patterns inside one individual. The behavior goes against itself. These are real conflicts in logic. Most people who are blamed to be irrational do not have anything like that. They're not sick in any way. They just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are being confronted with some expectations.</p><p>Sometimes healthy people may want to switch to other kinds of behavior for some reason. We can help them, but we have to keep in mind that this is not about some minor thoughts. The chemistry of the whole organism will be affected. New behavior will seriously contradict the existing one.</p><p>We expect to see the withdrawal symptoms during the switch. The relationships in the groups will be destroyed. You cannot change a side for real and pretend that nothing happened. It's not just dreams. There will be consequences. You have to burn your old life to build a new one. Not every person out there will be ready to pay the price. It will look like an irrational thing to do.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/fear">Fear</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;14</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-774345" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-774345)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/84322a33ebd4f7b2517936dc57be6532.jpg" alt="Fear" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>You're a little animal. You sit in your forest. It's a warm summer evening. You have your family with you, some food, and a comfortable shelter. Everything is fine. The sun goes down. It's time to sleep. You close your eyes and disappear... No. The forest is way too calm. Something is off. You start to look around. Nothing. Subtle smell of flowers, some fireflies are dancing around. Home, sweet home. You close your eyes. No. No. No. There is a shadow between the trees. Wait. Where is it? Oh, there is another one! You start to see the eyes glazing at you from the darkness. The bugs crawl under your skin. You feel how somebody touches you from behind. You cannot move. You're frozen. The evil poisoned your mind. The primal dread became your second shadow. You cannot fight it. It's in your head. You cannot run away. It's inside you. Some old legends say the fear can kill you. This is it. The end. The only thing you can do is to sit and wait for the inevitable.</p><p>Psychologists tend to use the term "fear" loosely. We often mix completely different things using this word, losing the context, and making therapy less effective. I think that we should be more careful. There are several flavors of fear.</p><p>The first one is a part of the fight-or-flight response, or whatever you call it these days. The bear attacks. You have to do something. Your body prepares for action. It's an immediate reaction that takes a lot of energy. It will not last forever. You need to stop and eat from time to time. Get yourself refueled. In some sense, this reaction is universal for every species and every pattern of behavior. We all have it one way or another. It just looks slightly different, depending on the body design and biases towards proactive or reactive behavior.</p><p>The second type of fear is that dread that makes you stuck. It makes you paranoid without any visible reason. You cannot do anything. Your body doesn't work at all. This fear can last. It doesn't require much energy. It just keeps you alert all night long. In my theory, this sort of fear is deeply interconnected with specific patterns of behavior. Adult apex predators cannot get this reaction at all. It just doesn't fit in their patterns.</p><p>The third type of fear is the rules-based one. It requires intelligence. If you create and follow the rules, then you can acquire a set of rules that makes you avoid something. If you pierce your throat with a fish bone, you'll probably make a rule to avoid that kind of fish in the future. This is different from the first two kinds of fear. It's in your memory. You can make hundreds and thousands of rules for all sorts of subjects and life scenarios. They don't require any energy to be kept in memory, and they can stay with you forever.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/make-it-black">Make it black</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-313757" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-313757)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e2740ef71cddebd7004f31984dca3bf7.jpg" alt="Make it black" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>One of the things that can happen in the graph of memories is cognitive dissonance. Memories just don't match each other or some data that comes from the inputs of the system.</p><p>It's not necessarily a bad thing. It happens all the time in every system that interacts with its environment. It changes. Data has to be updated. It takes some time. Meanwhile, some types of bugs can appear in the system. In human terms, you'll feel a bit confused.</p><p>The brain should be able to update the memory graph and remove the conflicts. In dissociative disorders we get lots of wrong connections simultaneously, and the process of recovery becomes tricky, even impossible in some cases, but if you're healthy, then you have nothing to worry about. This dissonance is a temporary inconvenience.</p><p>During traumatic events, you can get a serious dissonance. If you had a person who've been with you for your whole life, that person should be connected to a lot of things in the memory graph. If you lose him, it would take a lot of time to fix the connections. To make them match the world outside. It can become annoying at some point. Usually people start to notice the dissonances only in these harsh circumstances.</p><p>Technically, humor is a way to create small dissonances in controllable conditions. There are fifty shades of humor. The black one is the closest to the things that psychologists may perceive as traumas. But the joke is tiny. It doesn't hit any deep connections in the graph. The brain quickly adapts to the dissonance. It's not disturbing.</p><p>In some sense, black humor is like a vaccine. You get a minor feeling of dissonance in the context of traumatic events. You get comfortable with it. When the time comes, you don't feel too confused. It's not about positive emotions and laughing, but about your ability to sit tight while your brain is working hard to fix the outdated connections in the memory.</p><p>It seems like this is not a very popular opinion in psychological circles, but maybe we should be less serious. And this relates to the academic community as well. Professionals often stick to old theories. It's hard to make a discussion. It's hard to bring new approaches. They feel too confused. Too anxious. Lost. It becomes much easier if you draw the horns on the portrait of grandpa Freud on that wall and ask some silly questions from time to time.</p><p>Make a cup of humor every morning. Make it black. Enjoy it. Open the window. Let the sweet smell of exhaust gases with a fresh note of garbage accompany the beautiful melody of your neighbour's drill. The world can wait.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/and-how-does-that-make-you-feel">And how does that make you feel?</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;15</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-66409" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-66409)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/af3023a3ea2106e2a3bca984cffce4c8.jpg" alt="And how does that make you feel?" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The central part of my theory of behavior, the mechanism that connects the basic impulses, is a finite-state machine.</p><p>We can add some time modifiers for the basic impulses.

Prey will never feel the pleasant anticipation of supremacy when you're preparing to taste the fresh blood of your opponent. It's a purely predatory thing to feel.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don't have the names for all the states of this machine. For all emotions. This makes the research difficult. It's exactly the situation where the language determines thought. Without the words, it may feel like there is nothing to explore there. There is something.</p><p>If we assume that these feelings are a signalling system that helps to coordinate the activities inside the individual, or to coordinate the actions with the neighbours, then the question arises: how do you control them? Is it even possible? Or maybe this control is just some useless wordplay, because technically the emotion is just the description of the state of the machine?</p><p>In the field of psychology, the control of emotions is a popular thing to discuss. However, I always felt like there was something off about it. The only way to really change emotions is by changing behavior. If your behavior is the same, you'll get back to the same combinations of emotions over and over, no matter how hard you're trying to control them.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/scattered-morality">Scattered morality</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;10</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-343217" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-343217)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/da3e17d4daa664da7f3753d9aa637079.jpg" alt="Scattered morality" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Values. Virtues. Priorities. Morality. Where do all these things come from? Looking from the perspective of the <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a>, we expect to see two kinds of values: personal and collective.</p><p>Personal values come from the patterns of behavior. If something supports the pattern, it is good. If something stops the pattern, it is bad.</p><p>We expect to see a unique set of personal values for every pattern of the class I. Some of them can be combined within the patterns of the class II. Some of them contradict each other in diseases. These personal values change when the individual switches to another pattern of behavior.</p><p>This kind of evaluation, what's good or bad, does not require any intelligence to be used. It comes from the alignment of the upcoming events with the patterns. No rules to create here. Little kids and animals seem to use this kind of values. They don't need to be taught what's important. They already know. This is the most primal kind of judgement. The inevitable one.</p><p>Collective morality is different. It is a set of created rules. We need intelligence to create and follow the rules. Those little kids and most animals will have problems with them.</p><p>Created rules are not connected to the fixed patterns of behavior anymore. We expect to see the variety of them being invented, changed, and discarded through history. Naturally, different social groups will have different sets of created and shared rules.</p><p>There is no such thing as universal objective morality. Personal values from one pattern will inevitably contradict the values from some other patterns. Created rules will follow the interests of different individuals and groups, and will contradict the rules created by their neighbours.</p><p>There are ways to balance the collective interests to some degree. However, the personal pattern-based values are fixed. The only way to change them is by switching patterns. But we cannot make all men use just one pattern for a long period of time. We need different patterns to sustain and develop civilization. This is the curse that humanity has to deal with. And all those theoretical alien civilizations will have the same problem as well. Actually, this can be a sad solution to the Fermi paradox. We are all doomed to never work together efficiently. And to colonize the universe we have to do that.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/practical-observations">Practical observations</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;05&nbsp;/&nbsp;26</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-181536" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-181536)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e9442e1b2a14dd8a7b950f3444dc7870.jpg" alt="Practical observations" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>I put an accent on this in the book, but it seems to be important to clarify a couple of moments, related to the practical observations. Just to make sure that we don't have any room for misinterpretations.</p><p>The <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a> is about actions. Thoughts, emotions, and the words that are being used to express them, mean nothing, until they become the real observable actions. Individuals that use the reactive patterns of behavior often overestimate their proactive abilities in conversations and vice versa. We need to pay the attention to the actions only.</p><p>Also, results do not define approaches. If we give a relatively complex task with some degree of freedom, like having a lunch for example, to several individuals, then we will see the different approaches.</p><p>Somebody gets ten burgers, two bottles of soda on top, and then lies on a sofa, too tired to do anything else. Somebody gets an egg, espresso, and calls it a day. Somebody creates all sorts of rules. I sit here. You sit there. Knife on the right side. Fork on the left. Some speech is required. Somebody gets a pig's head, puts an apple in its mouth, adds leaves and flowers, creating a piece of art and telling a story in the process. At the end, some food will be eaten in all scenarios. The results will be practically the same, but the approaches are completely different and correspond to the different patterns of behavior.</p><p>In this context, it should be obvious that the profession does not define the behavior. Although some patterns would be more practical in some circumstances.</p><p>In many psychological schools, things are constructed in reverse. The emotions come first, and the actions are just the final results. But in our system actions are everything.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">The evolutionary theory of behavior</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;03&nbsp;/&nbsp;14</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="1080" width="1920"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-678891" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-678891)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/df8775320defaf79dcd42066dc4f04df.jpg" alt="The evolutionary theory of behavior" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>In the fields of psychiatry, psychology, we have a lot of problems right now. The causes of the diseases are not really determined. The symptoms are vague and hard to differentiate. The treatments often look like an alchemy. Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Who knows. Maybe another will work. Or not. The psychological theories allow some very loose interpretations, where the chemical processes behind the processes in the psyche should be very precise. In the world of neurochemistry, we have a lot of scattered pieces of information, but they do not explain how all these things work together.</p><p>We definitely need some fresh eyes. So I started the project, that is supposed to bring the new approaches, the new ways to interpret the collected information in the world of psychaitry. I use the ideas from the completely different fields, from the ancient philosophy to the modern computer science and engineering, to shake things a bit.</p><p>The first part of the project was published as the <a href="/evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a>. This is a theory that connects the parts of the psyche, the basic impulses, the observable patterns of behavior, the diseases and the effects in the social groups, attaching everything to the one purely mechanical model.</p><p>The second part of the project is the search for this model, or the similar one, in the field of neurochemistry. Instead of trying to explain every little fact on its own, I look for the similar graph of connections between things. My main hypothesis is that if we can connect things from the outside, the similar graph of connections should be somewhere on the inside. If we find it, it will show us the exact places where the diseases begin. This is a long shot. I know. But it is worth trying.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/publications">publications</a></li><li><a href="/tag/books">books</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article></main> <nav> <h2>Search for:</h2> <br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/emotions/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">emotions&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/evolution/" style="font-size: 122.41379310344827%">&starf;&nbsp;evolution&nbsp;(41)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/free_will/" style="font-size: 87.24137931034483%">free_will&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/intelligence/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">intelligence&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/language/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">language&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/memory/" style="font-size: 90.34482758620689%">memory&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/methodology/" style="font-size: 89.3103448275862%">methodology&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/morality/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">morality&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/philosophy/" style="font-size: 97.58620689655172%">philosophy&nbsp;(17)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/psychology/" style="font-size: 95.51724137931035%">psychology&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/religion/" style="font-size: 83.10344827586206%">religion&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/schizophrenia/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">schizophrenia&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> <br><br>+<br><br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/animation/" style="font-size: 140%">animation&nbsp;(58)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/books/" style="font-size: 88.27586206896552%">books&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/canvas/" style="font-size: 110%">canvas&nbsp;(29)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/codepen/" style="font-size: 155.51724137931035%">codepen&nbsp;(73)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/css/" style="font-size: 119.3103448275862%">css&nbsp;(38)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/github/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">github&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/habrahabr/" style="font-size: 108.96551724137932%">habrahabr&nbsp;(28)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/html/" style="font-size: 111.0344827586207%">html&nbsp;(30)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/javascript/" style="font-size: 141.0344827586207%">javascript&nbsp;(59)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/linux/" style="font-size: 81.03448275862068%">linux&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/math/" style="font-size: 99.65517241379311%">math&nbsp;(19)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/music/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">music&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/photography/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">photography&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/podcast/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">podcast&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/publications/" style="font-size: 113.10344827586206%">publications&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/svg/" style="font-size: 103.79310344827587%">svg&nbsp;(23)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/webgl/" style="font-size: 100.6896551724138%">webgl&nbsp;(20)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> </nav> <footer>Copyright &copy; Ivan Bogachev 2016-2025</footer> <script>const images=document.querySelectorAll("img");images.forEach(e=>{e.complete?e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0):e.addEventListener("load",()=>{e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0)})})</script> <script src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script> </body> </html>
