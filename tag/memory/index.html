It's true.</p><p>Associations. They may look differently, depending on your technical design, but their role is to connect other sequences. These are like edges of the graph of memories.</p><p>Rules. These are like instructions for reasoning and behavior, based on one-directional associations. It's your program.</p><p>Patterns.

Yes, it may sound odd outside of the IT world, but that's the fact. Programs in our computers don't speak, but they work with all these things.</p><p>What happens when we add a language? We add a bunch of facts. Words. We find more patterns for grammar and stuff. We add associations to connect words with our facts and symbols.</p><p>When you walk through your graph of memories, you can grab the words that are connected to your path. Make a sentence. It doesn't have to be grammatically perfect, but you can explain your line of thought to others. But what if your path goes through multiple sequences with no words associated with them?</p><p>Fact can be reproduced as it is. You can draw a picture, make a sound, or whatever your design allows you to do. If your listener has similar experiences, it can be enough to make the right guess. It's not a silver bullet, but it works.</p><p>Associations are easy to explain. Things come together. We connect them. Rules are the same. You can forget why you created some rules, but you can share them with us. If you use transitivity, then just explain everything step by step.</p><p>But what about patterns? If you don't have any words for a symbol or its parts, then you have a problem. It would be practically impossible to explain it. You may share every fact in a symbolic group, but it's highly unlikely that your opponent will find some tricky pattern immediately.</p><p>If you spend some time with data from the same environment, you find a lot of patterns and get a good understanding of it, but there are no words to explain it.

You save and extract data from your memory. What's next? How to evolve? Try to mix things. Associate sequences of data if they come together.</p><p>Now compare some sequences. Are they identical? Similar? You don't understand anything at this moment, but you can make a rule. A to B. Once you receive a sequence A, find that rule and proceed to B.</p><p>Do you have any free will in your pockets? Use it. Override your instructions for behavior with new rules. You can create rules and follow them. You got a tiny bit of intelligence. Congratulations! You're a genius bacteria! It's time to <a href="/post/the-magical-number-6">increase your cache</a> and play with more complex relations.</p><p>Take three sequences. A. B. S. If A = S, and B = S, then A = B. You just learned Euclidean relations. Great. Try to work with parts. If A includes S1 and S2, and B includes S1 and S2, then A = B. We're getting somewhere. Try to compare a lot of sequences.

You can build a lot of things, even a fancy conflict-resolving module for your rules, where you wander around the memory graph and find alternative rules for some tricky situation.</p><p>We may be from different species, but we exist in the same environment and have similar sensors. We likely receive similar sequences of data. We find more or less the same patterns and save them as symbols. This is our collective unconscious. By using it, we align our actions even if we don't know each other and don't have any common language.</p><p>Oh, right. We'll need a language. Our internal worlds may be relatively unique, but we associate sequences that come together. One day we'll find a common sequence. A word. An adapter between one of my sequences and one of yours.

They affect our <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">behavior</a>. But how do you technically recognize yourself in data?</p><p>I see a system as conscious if it saves and extracts data in real time. If you stop all data flows, the consciousness goes away. Complex systems may have many data channels connected to their memory. We can see different levels of consciousness, depending on which set of channels is active at the moment.</p><p>If you have a memory, a bunch of sensors, and data channels to connect everything, you may start to react to things in a structured manner. On the lower levels of evolution, where random mutations affect everything, we would expect to see all sorts of odd reactions. They don't have to make any logical sense to us. Natural selection will take care of them.</p><p>If your system is functionally independent from other things, it would be very convenient to mark sensors or channels as internal or external. You get that mutation, sooner or later.</p><p>These are simple binary flags. It definitely works on the level of bacteria. They don't necessarily have enough brains to understand what they're doing in detail, but they collect data and use it to guide their behavior in the environment.</p><p>At this moment your system is aware of the fact that there is you and there is an environment. And it's not the same. This is the most primal version of self-awareness that you can get.</p><p>You would probably say that this is far from our human self-awareness. Yes. But we add more internal sensors and connect data channels in loops. This is where the real magic begins.</p><p>You may observe data extraction from your memory. Now you're aware that you're aware. You can clearly see <a href="/post/selfie">your selfies</a> being used. Some people would probably argue that this is where you get the "real" consciousness and self-awareness.</p><p>If you have intelligence and work with rules, you may observe their creation. You make your own decisions! This data comes from your internal channels. It's yours! It's your will! Philosophers may call this an illusion, in the sense that this will is not free from prior causes, but it's a functional part of the system anyway. You won't be a human without it.</p><p>New sensors. More loops. More data. More rules. More bizarre effects. Eventually you pass the mirror test. But. It's not a functional self-awareness test. It's an IQ test. It's not enough to distinguish yourself from the environment. That's easy. You need to <a href="/post/the-magical-number-6">work with Euclidean relations in your data to pass the mirror test</a>. We have to be aware of that.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/intelligence">intelligence</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/selfie">Selfie</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;11</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-30910" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-30910)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/9e6948dc12b7fe7cfb9409bb3105d4ef.jpg" alt="Selfie" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>I'm more interested in answering the question "how the machine works?" first, rather than speculating on "how it sees itself?" with no blueprints on hand. But there are some limitations to the process that we can predict for any system. Let's dive into that.</p><p>In order to save any picture of anything, we need a memory mechanism. Then we add sensors to collect data and channels to transfer it into that memory. Once an image is created, we can use it.</p><p>Sometimes we have degenerate cases, like where the sensor and memory are located in the same place and we could say that the channel has zero length. Think about a film camera.</p><p>But, technically, that's it. We don't need much to save data. Later, we'll need a processor to process everything, but not right now.</p><p>If a system has sensors to scan itself, it'll be able to make a selfie. And yes, if we have enough energy, we can make this work for every part of it.</p><p>Series of snapshots of sensors and data channels allow us to monitor things. Ideally, it's a more or less real-time log of everything that happens with data in the system.</p><p>Logs constantly accumulate. In the real world we may have recent copies, but we don't save all logs from the beginning of time. We'll need to constantly add more storage for that.</p><p>Snapshots of data in memory can be done as well. But again, we can't create a full copy of a storing device and save it in itself. It'll not fit. We can make a partial image. By saving these images, we create a history of some part of the system.</p><p>Most likely we don't have sensors for everything. This means that our logs and snapshots include just some part of the story. There are things that we don't see. It's expected.</p><p>On average, people associate data in recent logs with consciousness and qualia, data in history with self-identity, and data in unmonitored channels with unconscious.</p><p>Some would say that our hardware is a material body and data is an immaterial soul. We definitely have some functional differences here.

They're often perceived as a part of schizophrenia, and I argued that it's an independent problem. But that's just a drop in the ocean.</p><p>At the current stage of the project, I reconnect data sets from various books and papers, and I see that the word "hallucination" is being used for many different things. It leads to serious problems in classifications of disorders, not only behavior-related ones.</p><p>Let's take a look at our system from above. There are four parts with different functional roles: sensors, data channels, memory, and processors. Depending on your design, you may have many of them connected to each other or working in parallel.</p><p>If we have a malfunction in the sensor, wrong data is entering our system. This is the first type of problem.</p><p>If the data channels are compromised, we expect to see anomalies in the data flows inside the system. We can measure delays in receiving data, phase shifts, lost signals, amplitude changes, or something like that.</p><p>Also, we can imagine man-in-the-middle attacks, where multiple channels are being physically reconnected in an unusual manner, and some data leaks into the wrong channel.</p><p>If the processes in our memory lose synchronization, we experience true hallucinations that look like dreams, effects like deja vu, and dissociative disorders.</p><p>All these issues with data in memory can happen in a healthy system if you force it to skip its maintenance cycle. They're not necessarily caused by damage to the mechanism itself. If you destroy it, you'll lose data, obviously, but most phenomena here require hardware that actually works.</p><p>If the processor misinterprets data, we get wrong results in our calculations. It can be a poorly protected algorithm, consistently failing to process some particular piece of data, or physical damage that leads to random mistakes.</p><p>For centuries, scholars mixed all sorts of problems with data under the same word. Hallucination. Usually they're organized by data type and the corresponding sensors.</p><p>It's an expected issue. At first, we pay attention to the observable effects. With time, we collect more data on the causes and replace our naive classifications with more precise ones. It's a part of the process. But our data can become very dirty during the transition period. We experience this right now in psychiatry. Some data just smells bad. Be careful.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-ghost-within">The ghost within</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;07</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-459279" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-459279)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/89e782e408643e919b39a28cb78805eb.jpg" alt="The ghost within" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The concept of inner child is one of the mysteries of psychology. It's there, but you can't measure it. It affects you, but maybe not. You can interact with it, but not shoot it dead. It's not a child, but a ghost of a child.</p><p>From our perspective, there is only one object that fits the profile. A part of the memory graph that was constructed relatively long ago and includes at least one rule.</p><p>The main problem here is that the rule itself and the data that was a reason to create it are two separate things. If you delete the rule and keep the data, it's not a problem, but if you lose the data, but keep the rule, then you get yourself a ghost rule. A rule with no reason to be there.</p><p>People who use the same patterns of behavior for their whole lives may never think about these things. You ain't need no inner child to be a man! It's because all their rules point them more or less in the same direction.</p><p>Some people may want to switch to another pattern. It's not a problem, but you need to update the rules. Some of them are universal. Language. Basic skills. Profession. But some rules may be connected to a specific pattern that you've used before. It's time to delete them.</p><p>But if some rule doesn't have a reason to exist anymore, it would be hard to evaluate how important the rule is. For some it will feel safer to keep it intact. This is the way to get stuck between patterns, not using your full potential with the new ones.</p><p>Usually, the concept of inner child comes into play in relation to <a href="/post/trauma">trauma</a>, but it looks like the trauma is a special case. Old rules exist in your memory regardless of your patterns. Clients in therapy will never cover the whole variety of possible behaviors, but it should be obvious that one becomes a prey only because there are predators out there. They may have rules, not related to traumas, but the same conflict inside.</p><p>The most popular way to deal with ghosts from the past in folklore is giving them what they want. Apparently, this is the technique of choice for many therapists these days. Take your inner child and fulfill his needs. No, it's not magic!</p><p>It kind of works. But you have to be careful. Your goal is to destroy what's left of the old pattern. Not to encourage it. Be not afraid to burn things. There is no such thing as "true self" to lose here. There are old rules and new rules. If you got two incompatible rules, you just choose one and stick with it. This is who you are. For now. One day you'll become a ghost yourself and will haunt the future you.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/updating-memory">Updating memory</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-703225" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-703225)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/c7eb0a18085976d703464bcf41aa5cb0.jpg" alt="Updating memory" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>What happens when you update data in your memory? It's a complex process. It takes some time, and there are distinct stages in it that can be important for us. Let's take a look.</p><p>First. You got a new piece of data. It's in your system, but it's not yet connected to anything in the main graph of memories. Updates in the real world are not instant. There is some lag to expect. In many cases you have to proceed with your tasks with slightly outdated information. Psychologists will call this "denial". You have data, but you don't use it.</p><p>Second. The process of updating has started. Now you have conflicts in memory. Some new connections were added. Some old data is still there. It's a mess. Usually, in computer systems, we avoid any actions at this stage. Operations with partially updated memory tend to destabilize everything. It's safer to stop and wait. In terms of psychologists, it's like a state of "bargaining". There are potential conflicts inside.</p><p>Third, the process finished. Your memory is up-to-date. You're good to go. This is what you would probably call "acceptance".</p><p>These three stages of the process are absolutely inevitable. Every heartless machine has them. But your system, depending on its design, may or may not have additional signals for self-diagnosing and internal synchronization.</p><p>Before the first stage, you may get a signal from your inputs that the update is required. It's a kick-starter. A flash. It doesn't last long. We may call this a "surprise", "shock", or whatever word feels more suitable for the circumstances.</p><p>Before the second stage, you already have the data, and you may evaluate the resources required for the update and further actions. At this point you may get a bunch of signals all over the system that order the parts of it to redirect energy. A lot of things happen simultaneously. Priorities change. Some subsystems lose resources. We may call this "frustration".</p><p>Before the third stage, you may diagnose the system again to see how much resources you've spent and what's left. You may need this data to plan your further survival. In human terms it's either "relief", or "tiredness", or something like that.</p><p>Psychologists often describe the stages of grief in a similar fashion. The main issue is that they tell you what we see, but not what happens. In the result, you can get various poetic word plays that are very hard to test. But when you look from the inside, you see the inevitable parts of the process. And they're not about your feelings, really. Every one of them has a purely engineering reason to be there.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/make-it-black">Make it black</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-313757" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-313757)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e2740ef71cddebd7004f31984dca3bf7.jpg" alt="Make it black" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>One of the things that can happen in the graph of memories is cognitive dissonance. Memories just don't match each other or some data that comes from the inputs of the system.</p><p>It's not necessarily a bad thing. It happens all the time in every system that interacts with its environment. It changes. Data has to be updated. It takes some time. Meanwhile, some types of bugs can appear in the system. In human terms, you'll feel a bit confused.</p><p>The brain should be able to update the memory graph and remove the conflicts. In dissociative disorders we get lots of wrong connections simultaneously, and the process of recovery becomes tricky, even impossible in some cases, but if you're healthy, then you have nothing to worry about. This dissonance is a temporary inconvenience.</p><p>During traumatic events, you can get a serious dissonance. If you had a person who've been with you for your whole life, that person should be connected to a lot of things in the memory graph. If you lose him, it would take a lot of time to fix the connections. To make them match the world outside. It can become annoying at some point. Usually people start to notice the dissonances only in these harsh circumstances.</p><p>Technically, humor is a way to create small dissonances in controllable conditions. There are fifty shades of humor. The black one is the closest to the things that psychologists may perceive as traumas. But the joke is tiny. It doesn't hit any deep connections in the graph. The brain quickly adapts to the dissonance. It's not disturbing.</p><p>In some sense, black humor is like a vaccine. You get a minor feeling of dissonance in the context of traumatic events. You get comfortable with it. When the time comes, you don't feel too confused. It's not about positive emotions and laughing, but about your ability to sit tight while your brain is working hard to fix the outdated connections in the memory.</p><p>It seems like this is not a very popular opinion in psychological circles, but maybe we should be less serious. And this relates to the academic community as well. Professionals often stick to old theories. It's hard to make a discussion. It's hard to bring new approaches. They feel too confused. Too anxious. Lost. It becomes much easier if you draw the horns on the portrait of grandpa Freud on that wall and ask some silly questions from time to time.</p><p>Make a cup of humor every morning. Make it black. Enjoy it. Open the window. Let the sweet smell of exhaust gases with a fresh note of garbage accompany the beautiful melody of your neighbour's drill. The world can wait.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/broken-timelines">Broken timelines</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;23</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-366754" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-366754)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/dd6e8024a8d553a94a70399c0bb4c4ed.jpg" alt="Broken timelines" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>I did that. Then I did that. Then I don't remember. Then I found myself on the other side of the city. I heard this story many times from the patients with schizo-spectrum disorders in private conversations. Minutes. Hours. Durations can be different, but the story is the same. The main timeline in the memory is broken.</p><p>According to the patients' observations, this problem correlates with bad sleep. It looks like a negative symptom of schizophrenia, but technically seems to be more like a version of the dissociative disorder, added on top of it.</p><p>Previously, I described how we design memory <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">from an engineering perspective</a>. Why do we need sleep? What happens during memory maintenance? How do we get the dissociations? The broken timelines look exactly as we expect the data to look after the malfunctions of this kind. It's one of the possible scenarios. If it's the case, the memories are split, scattered, but not deleted. We can try to recover them.</p><p>We don't save data in one-dimensional data structures that are easy to break into halves, like lists or stacks. They're more like graphs. Many connections are all over the place. If you break the graph during the mentioned memory malfunction, some connections will be lost, but some have all the chances to be preserved. Yes, it depends on the actual storing algorithm. We don't know all the details yet. But it's likely that one minor glitch will not break all the connections at once.</p><p>This is the time to remember the old, trusty, much criticized psychoanalysis. And free associations. We need to find the alternative connections between the events in the accessible parts of the timeline and the events in the lost parts. This way we reconnect and reinforce the graph of memories.</p><p>In most cases we can use logic and find the evidence of what was going on during the blackout. These events can be good starting points in our investigations.</p><p>I tried to do this analysis/reconnection a few times, and it worked. Seemingly lost memories were coming back. The timings were mixed up, but most logical connections between the events were there. The results are not perfect, but this is something. And something is better than nothing.</p><p>We will definitely need proper research here. More patients. Standardized conditions. Focus on different types of associations. These thoughts and interpretations are a little bit premature at this point. We have to understand that. But maybe they'll help somebody find something new.</p><p>P.S.: Failed defragmentation of the memory graph can lead to several kinds of long-term impairments. Not every one of them is technically reversible. The most dangerous problem is the accidental creation of new connections between things. Some would probably use the term "delusions" for them. Memory may look intact and be completely messed up at the same time. When working with memory, we should always validate data. Always. If something doesn't fit, we have to use logic and external evidence to fix it.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/a-dream-within-a-dream">A dream within a dream</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;23</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-79408" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-79408)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ea5c652e6bfe56e5d1d3df55b2de8942.jpg" alt="A dream within a dream" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>How do you know that you're not dreaming? Philosophers have asked this question for centuries. Everything got mixed up. Dreams. Illusions. Hallucinations. Simulated realities. Everything in one basket.</p><p>Technically, memory hallucinations, including dreams and effects like deja vu or jamais vu, are the results of data readouts during a hot memory maintenance. Defragmentation is the key process there. We expect to see a loss of continuity. Things will suddenly disappear or appear out of nowhere. Pay attention. Make notes. Compare notes. If something is off, you'll notice that.</p><p>Also, physics will be broken. Hallucinating brains will not be able to build the reflection that matches any random object. It's just a reading process that happens in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not a computation. Combinations of pieces of data can be complex and convincing, yes, but the objects have to be saved in advance. Usually we don't see things upside down, and they're not saved in our memory like that. Therefore, horizontal reflections of them cannot be hallucinated. Actually, it's a funny problem with AI image generators. Most of them have real troubles with rendering arbitrary objects upside down. For this exact reason. Oh, and vampires and other unholy otherworldly creatures don't reflect in rivers. It's the same thing.</p><p>However, you have to remember that you need to test things. If you don't remember that, you will get the "butterfly dream", that leads to all sorts of speculations about alternative realities. Once you do the tests and see the issues, it will become clear that your memory is hallucinating.</p><p>Being inside a simulated reality is different. It's like being inside a virtual machine. Everything will look normal, consistent. When the machine is under maintenance, everything stops. Looking from the inside, you'll not notice that. You'll be stopped yourself. The time will not exist for you.</p><p>Usually, when we create malware, we want it to know that it's not inside some virtual machine under investigation. How? We collect information about the system. We know what to expect in the real machine, and we look for something out of place. Virtual machines don't simulate every aspect of real ones. It requires a lot of resources and is unnecessary for standard applications. They may simulate hardware that was never produced by any manufacturer. Sometimes we expect to see some user activity and it's not there. We can use all these things as clues.</p><p>The problem with the offline world is that we don't know what is supposed to be here. Without that knowledge, all these comparisons are useless.</p><p>What if the machine itself is glitching? It's a good question. 99% of our code is utter garbage. Why would we even think that the programmers of the matrix are better in that department? We can look for bugs. Great. How do we know that something is a bug and not a feature? We compare the system's behavior with its specification. Where is our specification for the universe? Oh, wait. We got a problem.</p><p>Even if we imagine a program that somehow understands that it is running inside a virtual machine, even if it finds a way to break out, it's still a program, just running on real hardware. There is no way out of here.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article></main> <nav> <h2>Search for:</h2> <br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/emotions/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">emotions&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/evolution/" style="font-size: 122.41379310344827%">&starf;&nbsp;evolution&nbsp;(41)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/free_will/" style="font-size: 87.24137931034483%">free_will&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/intelligence/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">intelligence&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/language/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">language&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/memory/" style="font-size: 90.34482758620689%">memory&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/methodology/" style="font-size: 89.3103448275862%">methodology&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/morality/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">morality&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/philosophy/" style="font-size: 97.58620689655172%">philosophy&nbsp;(17)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/psychology/" style="font-size: 95.51724137931035%">psychology&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/religion/" style="font-size: 83.10344827586206%">religion&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/schizophrenia/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">schizophrenia&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> <br><br>+<br><br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/animation/" style="font-size: 140%">animation&nbsp;(58)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/books/" style="font-size: 88.27586206896552%">books&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/canvas/" style="font-size: 110%">canvas&nbsp;(29)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/codepen/" style="font-size: 155.51724137931035%">codepen&nbsp;(73)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/css/" style="font-size: 119.3103448275862%">css&nbsp;(38)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/github/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">github&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/habrahabr/" style="font-size: 108.96551724137932%">habrahabr&nbsp;(28)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/html/" style="font-size: 111.0344827586207%">html&nbsp;(30)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/javascript/" style="font-size: 141.0344827586207%">javascript&nbsp;(59)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/linux/" style="font-size: 81.03448275862068%">linux&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/math/" style="font-size: 99.65517241379311%">math&nbsp;(19)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/music/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">music&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/photography/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">photography&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/podcast/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">podcast&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/publications/" style="font-size: 113.10344827586206%">publications&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/svg/" style="font-size: 103.79310344827587%">svg&nbsp;(23)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/webgl/" style="font-size: 100.6896551724138%">webgl&nbsp;(20)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> </nav> <footer>Copyright &copy; Ivan Bogachev 2016-2025</footer> <script>const images=document.querySelectorAll("img");images.forEach(e=>{e.complete?e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0):e.addEventListener("load",()=>{e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0)})})</script> <script src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script> </body> </html>
