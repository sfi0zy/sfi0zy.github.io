Let's take free will for instance. One word. But. Psychologists may say that you use it to change your life. Physicists say it's impossible. Politics say it exists, but we don't want you to have it. Priests argue about freedom from god and mortal sins. Philosophers... you know, philosophers. It's a kindergarten. Every boy says that he is the real man and knows the truth.</p><p>In every field people look at the same universe. They just have different coordinate systems. We should be able to use geometric transformations to move all data into one system.</p><p>It's not just a simple linguistic translation word to word, but a projection, system to system. We can keep most of the relationships between data points and make a coherent picture using data from several fields simultaneously.</p><p>All coordinate systems should be interchangeable in our context. We can make a choice using our aesthetic preferences alone, but some options will be more convenient in practice.</p><p>For example, in physics, we have an axis from determinism towards randomness. It's hard to work with it. Data tends to be stretched between two extremes. It's either "pretty sure it's determined" or "pretty sure it's not". Our computers don't have enough precision to work with things in between.</p><p>It looks like you need free will to get away from determinism, but then you are immediately thrown into randomness. We can't work efficiently with complex models of reality in the middle.</p><p>If we get some inspiration from pagans, we may choose another axis, from order to chaos. It's similar, but it's not the same one. Data appears on our screens in a different shape.</p><p>You need the same free will to get away from order, but instead of two extremes we clearly see a spectrum. Some things can be more structured or more chaotic. We can work with that.</p><p>Wills look like proper forces now. They push you along the axis, free will in one direction and will to live in the opposite one. We see how they <a href="/post/path-of-order">affect our society</a>, how do you use them to <a href="/post/make-a-choice">make choices</a>, how do you <a href="/post/architect-mindset">actually build them</a>, why people may <a href="/post/freedom">see them differently</a>, etc. Everything suddenly works. We can compare our notes and make new theories.</p><p>Of course, every boy in the kindergarten will say that this is not the real free will and chaos is not true randomness. Exactly! That's the whole point. This approach is a cosmic compromise. It moves everything in one place and helps to see the big picture. We need it to build new things. Then you can project data back to your home field and use it in the "right" way.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/path-of-order">Path of order</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;05</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-545832" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-545832)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ec407c9a2bb4c588b7f35438259b8232.jpg" alt="Path of order" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>People in different groups may have <a href="/post/scattered-morality">conflicting values</a>, but in all cases we create rules to preserve what's important for us. Also, we need resources. We have to protect our society from direct destruction, but keep it refueled at the same time.</p><p>For every danger, we're trying to find a counterbalance that would be strong enough to stop it, but not too strong. We need to keep access to our resources. It's a tricky balance.</p><p>If you build a village in the middle of a desert to protect it from fire, your folks will have problems with hunting and foraging. If you put everybody in prison for minor violations, you'll have no workers to run your factories. If you reject all scary technologies, you'll likely have to spend more time doing your job in an old-fashioned way.</p><p>In management, we have to choose between weak control with more resources and strict control with fewer resources. In many cases you'll have a tempting choice to do things against the rules, off the record, to get something inaccessible.</p><p>Interestingly enough, determinists often reference the experiment with judges. If they eat well, they are more likely to vote for minor punishments, and vice versa. More resources come together with less control.</p><p>But all these rules for preservation and trials have nothing to do with human agency, or whatever you'll call it. We easily create rules for other species, for machines, for everything we have. When we evaluate the danger that comes from some subject, we think about our preservation, but not metaphysics.</p><p>What we can do, if a subject has intelligence, is to check the rules in his memory. If he has the rules to violate our rules, we get rid of him. If he doesn't have any rules to violate our rules, we may have a discussion. We can use his resources for our own benefit. Or not. We may have a rule to not negotiate.</p><p>You don't need an absolute god-like free will that violates all laws of physics to work with rules and order. Even in the world of machines, they may have tasks for self-preservation and resources to manage. There is nothing supernatural here.</p><p>However, free will in a more grounded sense, like the mechanism that mutates data in memory, is important. A subject that possesses the ability to change his own behavior has a great risk of becoming a rebel and destroying our system from the inside. And it doesn't matter if he uses his own agency or has some predetermined instructions to bring the cosmic chaos on our heads. He has enough freedom to cause problems anyway.</p><p>Will you vote to lock him away in advance to protect the order?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/make-a-choice">Make a choice</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;02</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-375044" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-375044)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/eadeb6a6576911c25b0316240b0ff113.jpg" alt="Make a choice" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>We portray our pagan ancestors in folklore as free and prideful men, standing against nature itself and playing with forces far beyond their control. They never kneel. They would better die fighting, rather than accept and obey. They value creativity. They're playing against all odds. They constantly transform themselves and the world. This path of change is dangerous. They pay with blood. But they are free.</p><p>In this context, we may treat freedom and change as almost equivalent things. You don't break free when you choose between the provided options and then argue about things that you could have done otherwise. You need to change the rules of the game. Create a new option that was never given to you. Don't choose the future. Make it. Burn the past and rise from the ashes like a phoenix. Become a new man. Build a new tomorrow.</p><p>These choices may look very personal, because you may associate yourself with your memory, and data from it is being used, but they have to include some things that can't come from the same memory. You need a mutation to happen in your data.</p><p>Depending on how you see yourself, the choices may look truly yours, or not. Many philosophers are flying in circles around the definition of "you" in this equation. As far as I can see, the answer depends on religions and historically affected cultural environments. But regardless of determinism, indeterminism, immaterial souls, or whatever stories you like, the problem reduces to memory and mutations in it.</p><p>If you aim to change your life, you have to let go. Both your past memories and active control. Get all your demons together and cut them loose. Allow chaos to provide you alternative options. Take one that is more or less aligned with the data in your mindset and use it. Just because you can.</p><p>Losing control? It's dangerous! No. No. No. Your will to live goes against your will to freedom. It's stupid. It's anarchy. It's inappropriate. Destroy stability? Take risks? Change everything? Seriously? Don't know what kind of witch made you think that it's a good idea, but we have to get rid of her. Your self-preservation mechanism protects you from changes.</p><p>On the level of societies, we see the same picture. Will to live is being constructed in the form of police, courts, prisons, censorship, etc. It protects the existence of society. But the price is freedom.</p><p>These days many people see freedom not in changes, not in rebellions, but in choosing which TV channel to watch. Some even say they don't have a choice. Maybe you need to remind yourself that you don't choose a choice.</p><p>You make a choice.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-devils-game">The Devil's game</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;15</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-47549" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-47549)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/c6135b5dc04911cce97a6d4793b5f526.jpg" alt="The Devils game" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>When we work with data, we don't really think about hardware. In most cases it's absolutely unnecessary. It doesn't matter what kind of materials and processes are present in your computer, as long as it works.</p><p>However, if we put a computer into the environment with high radiation, random events start to happen. You could say that one destroyed molecule in the processor will not affect the program. Most likely not. But if we wait long enough, we get to the point where small destructions accumulate and start to affect the system as a whole. It either stops working completely, or some glitches appear in the program, or in the memory, where the program saves data.</p><p>From the perspective of a program, this is a natural chaos that may or may not damage the system at any given moment. Of course, we can play with statistics. We can say that technically all these small particles and collisions are completely predetermined, but it doesn't matter. The robot knows that it is destined to go into that room with a melted reactor, but only a chance decides if the program will or will not work as expected.</p><p>Even if God doesn't play dice on the level of atoms, the robot still has to play the Devil's game on the level of programs and data.</p><p>When we talk about determinism in behavior, we often limit the path by the genes and the environment - education, family, friends, etc. We often say that some person is destined to end up in some place because all these factors are pushing him there.</p><p>But all these initial constants and environmental factors exist on the level of software. Our sensors don't see what's going on at the lower levels. Things happen, but we don't save them in our memory for further use in the process of decision-making. Some of these hidden events can provide unpredictable alternative options to consider.</p><p>It's funny to observe people talking about fate and destiny when they apply these concepts to individuals who actually choose these random options. They look at your past. They see the causes for everything. They predict your future. But the next day they have to change their tune and say that actually everything leads you to something completely different. And the next day it's something different again. And again, and again, and again.</p><p>I think that we should differentiate the physical determinism and the practical unpredictability of behavior. Past events in our memory are not everything. There is some degree of randomness that exists on its own and may affect our decisions.</p><p>What would you prefer, to stay where you are, correct the errors, discard deviating thoughts, and proceed with your life in an orderly fashion, or to embrace the chaos, play a game of chance, and build a different future?</p><p>The choice is yours.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/free-will-and-moral-responsibility">Free will and moral responsibility</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;12</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-962889" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-962889)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ebf2df10390026a78411760257509774.jpg" alt="Free will and moral responsibility" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>When we talk about moral responsibility, we usually mean that somebody has two options. He can either follow the rules of the group, or rebel against them. The judgement comes from the chosen path.</p><p>Different groups will have different rules. We expect that. It will not be a big problem, as long as you stay with just one group. But there is a much deeper question here.</p><p>Let's say we have a group with some rules and an individual on his own. In order to join, to follow the new moral rules of the group, he needs to have free will. He has to rewire his existing instructions for behavior. To rebel against his past. This is what the group members will expect him to do. To leave the past behind and become one of their own. To become a good person. But once he's there, they will want him to stop. He has to follow their rules and do not change his path ever again. Apparently, it's morally wrong to rebel the second time. He will become a traitor. A sinner.</p><p>This creates a brainwashing paradox of moral responsibility. You need to have free will to join the group of moralists, but you need to lose free will to stay in it. Otherwise you will be constantly bullied by other members of the group for thinking alternative thoughts, asking unwanted questions, and considering actions against their moral rules in general.</p><p>Not every group has this sort of moral pressure, of course. Some groups are open to changes. They are ready to let their members go. However, some groups are almost obsessed with their rules and stability.</p><p>In my theory, I proposed that this loss of free will, loss of the ability to change, is not a good thing. It's a sickness. It's a psychiatric disease that we haven't discovered yet. And these are not just thoughts out of nowhere. I saw some groups of people who do not just judge others all day long, but they repeat each other a lot. They repeat long sentences word by word. They repeat everyday actions. They literally cannot sustain a conversation about anything new. They seem to lose the ability to learn things. The longer you look, the more you see. At some moment it starts to feel like they're not human. It's kind of a creepy thing to observe, actually.</p><p>My point here is that the relations between moral responsibility and free will seem to be complicated. I even start to think that we don't treat the lack of free will as a separate disease just because a lot of societies in our world want to see their members not have it. They're being constantly told that it is morally good to follow the flow and be happy.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/architect-mindset">The architect's mindset</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;06&nbsp;/&nbsp;28</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-493457" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-493457)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e417661de1e956270ec6980fbb2b85d8.jpg" alt="The architects mindset" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Let's imagine we're architects. We have a task to design a machine, a replicant, that will mimic human behavior. Or some animal. Let's say we have a "free will" module. We can plug it into the replicant. But. What is the functional role of this module?</p><p>The average answer to this question in my environment is that this module gives the replicant the ability to rebel. To give a finger. To go outside the path that was prepared for him. Burn the bridges. Do things in his own way. If you provide him a 50/50 choice to press a left or right button, he will give you a finger and he will not press any of them. Without this module, he will be a robotic slave, repeating the same instructions over and over. Following the master's orders. With it, the replicant will always have the alternative options to consider in his decision-making unit.</p><p>To perform its role, the module has to be connected to the memory mechanism. It is supposed to extend or override the saved instructions, how to behave, with something outside of that memory.</p><p>First, this means that the "free will" module can work only with the systems of specific complexity. You need a memory mechanism to be present and filled with instructions. At least a read-only memory. Atoms don't have it. Stars don't have it. Human has. Dog has. Replicant will have.</p><p>Second, the "free will" module, by its design, leads to the alternative contradictory processes inside the replicant. They will be destructive either to his memory, or some other parts, including the complete self-destruction, or to his environment. The additional self-preservation module will help to balance things out in the long run. Also, this "free will" module is not the one that will make the replicant follow the same rules for a long period of time. Including the moral rules. We will have to add another module for that.</p><p>From the perspective of the architects, it doesn't really matter how exactly this module will work inside, as long as it fulfills its functional role. We can put the true randomness inside. It can be some determined but unpredictable system. It can be an antenna that receives a stream of data from the other side of the universe. Engineers will provide us options. As long as this mechanism is not being controlled directly from the memory of the replicant, it will work. It will make the replicant rebel.</p><p>The point of this passage is not to talk about the free will specifically, but to point a finger at the mindset that seems to be lacking in the western field of philosophy. Think like an architect. Think about systems. Modules. Functional roles. Connections. Use cases. Generalized patterns. This is the way to see the big picture, even if you don't possess the final engineering details. This mindset helps to bring different concepts together and to guide the further research, instead of producing all these endless debates that don't lead to any new information whatsoever.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/freedom">Freedom</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;06&nbsp;/&nbsp;01</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-565056" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-565056)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/bd85f0d1818cc1ef812041c3c70070fd.jpg" alt="Freedom" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Free will. I use it in my work. Never questioned it. But it seems like in the western philosophy people talk a lot about determinism. They have arguments against freedom. So I asked myself, why our ideas look so different?</p><p>During my childhood, I got two perspectives, two ways of seeing the freedom. One from the Eastern Orthodox Church, and another one from the local pagans and occultists.</p><p>Pagans believe in chaos. We come from it. We return to it. It is home. It is freedom. The absolute freedom. And even when we stuck in the limited material body, we still carry a piece of chaos inside. This is our nature. This is who we are. By embracing the chaos, we get the freedom to do anything. To change the world. I like this position. There is something in it.</p><p>Christians believe in the same chaos, but they associate it with sins. They agree that we all have it inside, but they say it's dangerous. It's like a spiritual sickness. It makes you do stupid things. You'll get hurt by following it. This is not the kind of freedom, that would be wise to have. They talk about the self-preservation a lot, actually. They give you a list of things that you're supposed to do to survive and protect your kin. They may call it a God's will. The right way to be. Whatever. They appreciate, when you exercise your will, and work hard according to these rules.</p><p>Both parties agree, that we do include some chaos inside us, some freedom to do things, but they have different opinions on what we should do with it. Some say we should embrace the chaos and do things just because we can, and some say we should work to control it, and preserve ourselves. This duality stuck very deep in my head, and, apparently, it got reflected in my work.</p><p>In the English-speaking world, at least in the debates on YouTube and Reddit, people are greatly influenced by Protestantism. They talk a lot about the faith, grace, and divine things, that generally happen on their own. They don't really talk about the chaos, and they don't talk about your personal actions that make the difference. You just need to have faith and the universe will take care of everything else. Psychological determinism fits quite naturally in this cultural environment. Things had been set for you already. You will not change anything. Freedom is an illusion.</p><p>I won't make any conclusions here. We don't have enough data to completely prove determinism, or to prove it wrong. These are just some thoughts on the cultural differences that may affect the behavior and our philosophical views.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/religion">religion</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article></main> <nav> <h2>Search for:</h2> <br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/emotions/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">emotions&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/evolution/" style="font-size: 122.41379310344827%">&starf;&nbsp;evolution&nbsp;(41)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/free_will/" style="font-size: 87.24137931034483%">free_will&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/intelligence/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">intelligence&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/language/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">language&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/memory/" style="font-size: 90.34482758620689%">memory&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/methodology/" style="font-size: 89.3103448275862%">methodology&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/morality/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">morality&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/philosophy/" style="font-size: 97.58620689655172%">philosophy&nbsp;(17)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/psychology/" style="font-size: 95.51724137931035%">psychology&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/religion/" style="font-size: 83.10344827586206%">religion&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/schizophrenia/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">schizophrenia&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> <br><br>+<br><br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/animation/" style="font-size: 140%">animation&nbsp;(58)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/books/" style="font-size: 88.27586206896552%">books&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/canvas/" style="font-size: 110%">canvas&nbsp;(29)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/codepen/" style="font-size: 155.51724137931035%">codepen&nbsp;(73)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/css/" style="font-size: 119.3103448275862%">css&nbsp;(38)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/github/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">github&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/habrahabr/" style="font-size: 108.96551724137932%">habrahabr&nbsp;(28)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/html/" style="font-size: 111.0344827586207%">html&nbsp;(30)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/javascript/" style="font-size: 141.0344827586207%">javascript&nbsp;(59)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/linux/" style="font-size: 81.03448275862068%">linux&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/math/" style="font-size: 99.65517241379311%">math&nbsp;(19)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/music/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">music&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/photography/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">photography&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/podcast/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">podcast&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/publications/" style="font-size: 113.10344827586206%">publications&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/svg/" style="font-size: 103.79310344827587%">svg&nbsp;(23)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/webgl/" style="font-size: 100.6896551724138%">webgl&nbsp;(20)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> </nav> <footer>Copyright &copy; Ivan Bogachev 2016-2025</footer> <script>const images=document.querySelectorAll("img");images.forEach(e=>{e.complete?e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0):e.addEventListener("load",()=>{e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0)})})</script> <script src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script> </body> </html>
