They affect our <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">behavior</a>. But how do you technically recognize yourself in data?</p><p>I see a system as conscious if it saves and extracts data in real time. If you stop all data flows, the consciousness goes away. Complex systems may have many data channels connected to their memory. We can see different levels of consciousness, depending on which set of channels is active at the moment.</p><p>If you have a memory, a bunch of sensors, and data channels to connect everything, you may start to react to things in a structured manner. On the lower levels of evolution, where random mutations affect everything, we would expect to see all sorts of odd reactions. They don't have to make any logical sense to us. Natural selection will take care of them.</p><p>If your system is functionally independent from other things, it would be very convenient to mark sensors or channels as internal or external. You get that mutation, sooner or later.</p><p>These are simple binary flags. It definitely works on the level of bacteria. They don't necessarily have enough brains to understand what they're doing in detail, but they collect data and use it to guide their behavior in the environment.</p><p>At this moment your system is aware of the fact that there is you and there is an environment. And it's not the same. This is the most primal version of self-awareness that you can get.</p><p>You would probably say that this is far from our human self-awareness. Yes. But we add more internal sensors and connect data channels in loops. This is where the real magic begins.</p><p>You may observe data extraction from your memory. Now you're aware that you're aware. You can clearly see <a href="/post/selfie">your selfies</a> being used. Some people would probably argue that this is where you get the "real" consciousness and self-awareness.</p><p>If you have intelligence and work with rules, you may observe their creation. You make your own decisions! This data comes from your internal channels. It's yours! It's your will! Philosophers may call this an illusion, in the sense that this will is not free from prior causes, but it's a functional part of the system anyway. You won't be a human without it.</p><p>New sensors. More loops. More data. More rules. More bizarre effects. Eventually you pass the mirror test. But. It's not a functional self-awareness test. It's an IQ test. It's not enough to distinguish yourself from the environment. That's easy. You need to <a href="/post/the-magical-number-6">work with Euclidean relations in your data to pass the mirror test</a>. We have to be aware of that.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/intelligence">intelligence</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/coordinate-system">Coordinate system</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;15</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-33448" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-33448)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/cced063e2155d599acd6315644e11e6f.jpg" alt="Coordinate system" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>We suffer from a <a href="/post/99-languages">99 languages problem</a>. Let's take free will for instance. One word. But. Psychologists may say that you use it to change your life. Physicists say it's impossible. Politics say it exists, but we don't want you to have it. Priests argue about freedom from god and mortal sins. Philosophers... you know, philosophers. It's a kindergarten. Every boy says that he is the real man and knows the truth.</p><p>In every field people look at the same universe. They just have different coordinate systems. We should be able to use geometric transformations to move all data into one system.</p><p>It's not just a simple linguistic translation word to word, but a projection, system to system. We can keep most of the relationships between data points and make a coherent picture using data from several fields simultaneously.</p><p>All coordinate systems should be interchangeable in our context. We can make a choice using our aesthetic preferences alone, but some options will be more convenient in practice.</p><p>For example, in physics, we have an axis from determinism towards randomness. It's hard to work with it. Data tends to be stretched between two extremes. It's either "pretty sure it's determined" or "pretty sure it's not". Our computers don't have enough precision to work with things in between.</p><p>It looks like you need free will to get away from determinism, but then you are immediately thrown into randomness. We can't work efficiently with complex models of reality in the middle.</p><p>If we get some inspiration from pagans, we may choose another axis, from order to chaos. It's similar, but it's not the same one. Data appears on our screens in a different shape.</p><p>You need the same free will to get away from order, but instead of two extremes we clearly see a spectrum. Some things can be more structured or more chaotic. We can work with that.</p><p>Wills look like proper forces now. They push you along the axis, free will in one direction and will to live in the opposite one. We see how they <a href="/post/path-of-order">affect our society</a>, how do you use them to <a href="/post/make-a-choice">make choices</a>, how do you <a href="/post/architect-mindset">actually build them</a>, why people may <a href="/post/freedom">see them differently</a>, etc. Everything suddenly works. We can compare our notes and make new theories.</p><p>Of course, every boy in the kindergarten will say that this is not the real free will and chaos is not true randomness. Exactly! That's the whole point. This approach is a cosmic compromise. It moves everything in one place and helps to see the big picture. We need it to build new things. Then you can project data back to your home field and use it in the "right" way.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/selfie">Selfie</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;11</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-30910" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-30910)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/9e6948dc12b7fe7cfb9409bb3105d4ef.jpg" alt="Selfie" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>I'm more interested in answering the question "how the machine works?" first, rather than speculating on "how it sees itself?" with no blueprints on hand. But there are some limitations to the process that we can predict for any system. Let's dive into that.</p><p>In order to save any picture of anything, we need a memory mechanism. Then we add sensors to collect data and channels to transfer it into that memory. Once an image is created, we can use it.</p><p>Sometimes we have degenerate cases, like where the sensor and memory are located in the same place and we could say that the channel has zero length. Think about a film camera.</p><p>But, technically, that's it. We don't need much to save data. Later, we'll need a processor to process everything, but not right now.</p><p>If a system has sensors to scan itself, it'll be able to make a selfie. And yes, if we have enough energy, we can make this work for every part of it.</p><p>Series of snapshots of sensors and data channels allow us to monitor things. Ideally, it's a more or less real-time log of everything that happens with data in the system.</p><p>Logs constantly accumulate. In the real world we may have recent copies, but we don't save all logs from the beginning of time. We'll need to constantly add more storage for that.</p><p>Snapshots of data in memory can be done as well. But again, we can't create a full copy of a storing device and save it in itself. It'll not fit. We can make a partial image. By saving these images, we create a history of some part of the system.</p><p>Most likely we don't have sensors for everything. This means that our logs and snapshots include just some part of the story. There are things that we don't see. It's expected.</p><p>On average, people associate data in recent logs with consciousness and qualia, data in history with self-identity, and data in unmonitored channels with unconscious.</p><p>Some would say that our hardware is a material body and data is an immaterial soul. We definitely have some functional differences here. However, data is the same matter or energy as everything else, so this is just poetry, not physics.</p><p>Logs and snapshots show us events in the past. Looking at them, the system sees itself not only partially, but always has outdated information as well. And it doesn't depend on how the observer module actually works.</p><p>How do you see yourself in this situation?</p><p>Are you the selfie, or the system that looks at its selfie?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/path-of-order">Path of order</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;05</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-545832" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-545832)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ec407c9a2bb4c588b7f35438259b8232.jpg" alt="Path of order" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>People in different groups may have <a href="/post/scattered-morality">conflicting values</a>, but in all cases we create rules to preserve what's important for us. Also, we need resources. We have to protect our society from direct destruction, but keep it refueled at the same time.</p><p>For every danger, we're trying to find a counterbalance that would be strong enough to stop it, but not too strong. We need to keep access to our resources. It's a tricky balance.</p><p>If you build a village in the middle of a desert to protect it from fire, your folks will have problems with hunting and foraging. If you put everybody in prison for minor violations, you'll have no workers to run your factories. If you reject all scary technologies, you'll likely have to spend more time doing your job in an old-fashioned way.</p><p>In management, we have to choose between weak control with more resources and strict control with fewer resources. In many cases you'll have a tempting choice to do things against the rules, off the record, to get something inaccessible.</p><p>Interestingly enough, determinists often reference the experiment with judges. If they eat well, they are more likely to vote for minor punishments, and vice versa. More resources come together with less control.</p><p>But all these rules for preservation and trials have nothing to do with human agency, or whatever you'll call it. We easily create rules for other species, for machines, for everything we have. When we evaluate the danger that comes from some subject, we think about our preservation, but not metaphysics.</p><p>What we can do, if a subject has intelligence, is to check the rules in his memory. If he has the rules to violate our rules, we get rid of him. If he doesn't have any rules to violate our rules, we may have a discussion. We can use his resources for our own benefit. Or not. We may have a rule to not negotiate.</p><p>You don't need an absolute god-like free will that violates all laws of physics to work with rules and order. Even in the world of machines, they may have tasks for self-preservation and resources to manage. There is nothing supernatural here.</p><p>However, free will in a more grounded sense, like the mechanism that mutates data in memory, is important. A subject that possesses the ability to change his own behavior has a great risk of becoming a rebel and destroying our system from the inside. And it doesn't matter if he uses his own agency or has some predetermined instructions to bring the cosmic chaos on our heads. He has enough freedom to cause problems anyway.</p><p>Will you vote to lock him away in advance to protect the order?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/make-a-choice">Make a choice</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;02</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-375044" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-375044)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/eadeb6a6576911c25b0316240b0ff113.jpg" alt="Make a choice" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>We portray our pagan ancestors in folklore as free and prideful men, standing against nature itself and playing with forces far beyond their control. They never kneel. They would better die fighting, rather than accept and obey. They value creativity. They're playing against all odds. They constantly transform themselves and the world. This path of change is dangerous. They pay with blood. But they are free.</p><p>In this context, we may treat freedom and change as almost equivalent things. You don't break free when you choose between the provided options and then argue about things that you could have done otherwise. You need to change the rules of the game. Create a new option that was never given to you. Don't choose the future. Make it. Burn the past and rise from the ashes like a phoenix. Become a new man. Build a new tomorrow.</p><p>These choices may look very personal, because you may associate yourself with your memory, and data from it is being used, but they have to include some things that can't come from the same memory. You need a mutation to happen in your data.</p><p>Depending on how you see yourself, the choices may look truly yours, or not. Many philosophers are flying in circles around the definition of "you" in this equation. As far as I can see, the answer depends on religions and historically affected cultural environments. But regardless of determinism, indeterminism, immaterial souls, or whatever stories you like, the problem reduces to memory and mutations in it.</p><p>If you aim to change your life, you have to let go. Both your past memories and active control. Get all your demons together and cut them loose. Allow chaos to provide you alternative options. Take one that is more or less aligned with the data in your mindset and use it. Just because you can.</p><p>Losing control? It's dangerous! No. No. No. Your will to live goes against your will to freedom. It's stupid. It's anarchy. It's inappropriate. Destroy stability? Take risks? Change everything? Seriously? Don't know what kind of witch made you think that it's a good idea, but we have to get rid of her. Your self-preservation mechanism protects you from changes.</p><p>On the level of societies, we see the same picture. Will to live is being constructed in the form of police, courts, prisons, censorship, etc. It protects the existence of society. But the price is freedom.</p><p>These days many people see freedom not in changes, not in rebellions, but in choosing which TV channel to watch. Some even say they don't have a choice. Maybe you need to remind yourself that you don't choose a choice.</p><p>You make a choice.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/cognitive-complexity">Cognitive complexity</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;17</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-714507" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-714507)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/0d68820e696f80bac30faf43d797aaef.jpg" alt="Cognitive complexity" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Scientific theories tend to be much simpler than IT systems. On the frontiers of science, demons hide themselves in novelty, but not in complexity. We use Occam's razor and appreciate elegant solutions for our problems.</p><p>In contrast, programmers rarely create completely new things these days, but the complexity of our systems can be overwhelming. We constantly work on the methods to decrease it. This is one of the main topics for debates in the field.</p><p>We use all sorts of design patterns to organize large amounts of code. They help a lot. No need to keep the whole project in your head all the time. But also we have discussions on how to write instructions that would be easy to understand.</p><p>If you have millions of lines of code in the project, the last thing you want is to read every one of them several times to get the logic. You don't write code for machines, you write it for people. By writing simple code you help your colleagues to spend their resources on actual development, instead of solving your puzzles with zero business value.</p><p>When you increase cognitive complexity with no reason, you create technical debt. It gradually slows down the development process. Increases the costs. It can kill the project eventually. There are rare exceptions where we accept dirty code in some utils to get better performance, but they're write-only things. Once they start to work, you leave them alone and never get back.</p><p>Some people used to argue that complex tasks require complex code, or that precision in algorithms makes code dense, or that abstract concepts are hard to understand by their nature, and that you need to grow as a professional to get it. None of this is true.</p><p>The moment we started to introduce the tools for static code analysis, to automatically prevent the obfuscated code from entering our projects, we realized that complex systems can be written in simple language. Of course, you need to learn the basics. You need to know the words. But the code can be easy to understand. When you write intricate code, it's likely not because you actually need it, it's because you choose it.</p><p>When I look at the language in academic publications, I feel like it's much more complex than it should be. Often, I have to read the same sentence many times to understand it. Not because of the subject matter, but because of the language.</p><p>It seems like people use the same arguments to protect this obscure language that programmers used back in the days to protect their bad code. But why?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/language">language</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-devils-game">The Devil's game</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;15</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-47549" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-47549)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/c6135b5dc04911cce97a6d4793b5f526.jpg" alt="The Devils game" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>When we work with data, we don't really think about hardware. In most cases it's absolutely unnecessary. It doesn't matter what kind of materials and processes are present in your computer, as long as it works.</p><p>However, if we put a computer into the environment with high radiation, random events start to happen. You could say that one destroyed molecule in the processor will not affect the program. Most likely not. But if we wait long enough, we get to the point where small destructions accumulate and start to affect the system as a whole. It either stops working completely, or some glitches appear in the program, or in the memory, where the program saves data.</p><p>From the perspective of a program, this is a natural chaos that may or may not damage the system at any given moment. Of course, we can play with statistics. We can say that technically all these small particles and collisions are completely predetermined, but it doesn't matter. The robot knows that it is destined to go into that room with a melted reactor, but only a chance decides if the program will or will not work as expected.</p><p>Even if God doesn't play dice on the level of atoms, the robot still has to play the Devil's game on the level of programs and data.</p><p>When we talk about determinism in behavior, we often limit the path by the genes and the environment - education, family, friends, etc. We often say that some person is destined to end up in some place because all these factors are pushing him there.</p><p>But all these initial constants and environmental factors exist on the level of software. Our sensors don't see what's going on at the lower levels. Things happen, but we don't save them in our memory for further use in the process of decision-making. Some of these hidden events can provide unpredictable alternative options to consider.</p><p>It's funny to observe people talking about fate and destiny when they apply these concepts to individuals who actually choose these random options. They look at your past. They see the causes for everything. They predict your future. But the next day they have to change their tune and say that actually everything leads you to something completely different. And the next day it's something different again. And again, and again, and again.</p><p>I think that we should differentiate the physical determinism and the practical unpredictability of behavior. Past events in our memory are not everything. There is some degree of randomness that exists on its own and may affect our decisions.</p><p>What would you prefer, to stay where you are, correct the errors, discard deviating thoughts, and proceed with your life in an orderly fashion, or to embrace the chaos, play a game of chance, and build a different future?</p><p>The choice is yours.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-rat">The rat</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;13</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-680337" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-680337)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/80893d33069dce24cd2a564f9d7697e1.jpg" alt="The rat" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Imagine a data center. Steel and glass, endless racks with servers, futuristic blue lights, thousands of hard drives, kilometers of cables, three power sources, ridiculous amounts of information, automatic backups for everything. You sit in your cabinet with eight monitors like a true hacker from that movie. Something is off, isn't it?</p><p>Yes, there is something. A repeating anomaly in some data flows. Sometimes it's there. Sometimes it's not. It's time for an investigation. You open the terminal and the journey begins. Logs, reports, more logs, more reports, some coffee. The logs will never end. You spend hours, days, nights, weeks, trying to locate it. It's there. But where is it? It's in your data, but there is no reason for it to be there. You start to question yourself at some moment. It's true madness. You're chasing a ghost in the net.</p><p>One day some newbie guard is getting lost, walks into a wrong corridor, and finds a big rat chewing on one of your cables.</p><p>The rat!</p><p>You didn't see that coming, did you? Yes, they eat cables. Now you know that. And they're not ghosts, obviously. You got a degree in computer science, but nobody ever told you that sometimes you have to get out of your terminal, stand up, and have a good walk around the building, looking for actual rats.</p><p>But this story is not about those curious animals. It's about the limits of knowledge. Sometimes you cannot catch a ghost because your data is very limited. Very. Limited. You expect to find a solution in your logs, looking for small inconsistencies in numbers, but you don't notice a whole offline world outside. Wake up, Neo. Follow the rat.</p><p>I was thinking about the hard problem of consciousness recently. It looks similar to this situation. We cannot solve it using the available data because we don't notice something really big. It doesn't mean we cannot learn the truth. We just have to get out of our information bubbles.</p><p>But how do we find a conscious rat if we don't know that the offline world exists? Is it possible to make a right guess without any external help? We can create new things by combining and mutating old things, following the process of evolution, but every step depends on the previous steps. It's like a mental trap that doesn't allow us to imagine some things outside of the <a href="/post/is-there-any-other-way">tree of combinations</a>.</p><p>Do we really have to wait for some external entity to make observations and reveal the knowledge to us?

We make them. Even my lecture notes for the <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">theory of behavior</a> include some. Apparently, my proofreaders from the IT world with their fancy AI spell checkers are way too tolerant. They're just some spelling bugs. They're annoying. They buzz in your ears. But they do not damage the system itself in any way. We can fix them, or even ignore them, and try to not repeat them ever again. As time goes on, we learn our lessons. The process is straightforward. Learn more rules. Make fewer mistakes.</p><p>Everything works fine. Until it doesn't. It turns out, there are different rules for the same language in different fields. You cannot follow all of them. They contradict each other.</p><p>And I'm not talking about all those complex writing styles that many scientists use for some reason. No. They're easy to balance. Just keep it simple. I'm talking about the words themselves. Sometimes the same word has completely different meanings in different contexts. Sometimes different terms are being used to describe the same thing, hiding the obvious. How do you deal with that?</p><p>You can create a new set of terms for your project. Others will have to learn everything from scratch. It's hard. You can borrow some meanings from one field and force them into some other fields. This creates confusion. No matter what you choose, it's not perfect.</p><p>My current project combines philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, programming, engineering, and now, at the second stage, it also gets biology, neuroscience, and some general physics involved. It's a linguistic mess that haunts the project from the very beginning.</p><p>The philosophical introduction to my theory explains the most important terms. It helps, but it's not enough. There is a whole bunch of IT-related concepts that are obvious to me and my colleagues, but not to some average psychologist or biologist. They use the same words with completely different meanings and everything falls apart in their heads. It starts to look like I need to make a second edition of my notes with ten pages of translations and explanations for every single page of actual theory. It doesn't feel right.</p><p>The academic community seems to avoid this problem, but it's big. We cannot see invariants clearly when the rules of language are messed up. Sometimes scholars spend years to rediscover common knowledge just because they cannot see it in front of them. It's really hard to reuse knowledge, unless you create your own symbolic language to fix the inconsistencies between the fields, but then nobody understands you.</p><p>What should we do? Is it time to stop fragmenting the science and create a universal language, like we do in large companies, to synchronize their business and IT departments?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/language">language</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/a-dream-within-a-dream">A dream within a dream</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;23</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-79408" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-79408)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ea5c652e6bfe56e5d1d3df55b2de8942.jpg" alt="A dream within a dream" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>How do you know that you're not dreaming? Philosophers have asked this question for centuries. Everything got mixed up. Dreams. Illusions. Hallucinations. Simulated realities. Everything in one basket.</p><p>Technically, memory hallucinations, including dreams and effects like deja vu or jamais vu, are the results of data readouts during a hot memory maintenance. Defragmentation is the key process there. We expect to see a loss of continuity. Things will suddenly disappear or appear out of nowhere. Pay attention. Make notes. Compare notes. If something is off, you'll notice that.</p><p>Also, physics will be broken. Hallucinating brains will not be able to build the reflection that matches any random object. It's just a reading process that happens in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not a computation. Combinations of pieces of data can be complex and convincing, yes, but the objects have to be saved in advance. Usually we don't see things upside down, and they're not saved in our memory like that. Therefore, horizontal reflections of them cannot be hallucinated. Actually, it's a funny problem with AI image generators. Most of them have real troubles with rendering arbitrary objects upside down. For this exact reason. Oh, and vampires and other unholy otherworldly creatures don't reflect in rivers. It's the same thing.</p><p>However, you have to remember that you need to test things. If you don't remember that, you will get the "butterfly dream", that leads to all sorts of speculations about alternative realities. Once you do the tests and see the issues, it will become clear that your memory is hallucinating.</p><p>Being inside a simulated reality is different. It's like being inside a virtual machine. Everything will look normal, consistent. When the machine is under maintenance, everything stops. Looking from the inside, you'll not notice that. You'll be stopped yourself. The time will not exist for you.</p><p>Usually, when we create malware, we want it to know that it's not inside some virtual machine under investigation. How? We collect information about the system. We know what to expect in the real machine, and we look for something out of place. Virtual machines don't simulate every aspect of real ones. It requires a lot of resources and is unnecessary for standard applications. They may simulate hardware that was never produced by any manufacturer. Sometimes we expect to see some user activity and it's not there. We can use all these things as clues.</p><p>The problem with the offline world is that we don't know what is supposed to be here. Without that knowledge, all these comparisons are useless.</p><p>What if the machine itself is glitching? It's a good question. 99% of our code is utter garbage. Why would we even think that the programmers of the matrix are better in that department? We can look for bugs. Great. How do we know that something is a bug and not a feature? We compare the system's behavior with its specification. Where is our specification for the universe? Oh, wait. We got a problem.</p><p>Even if we imagine a program that somehow understands that it is running inside a virtual machine, even if it finds a way to break out, it's still a program, just running on real hardware. There is no way out of here.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/problem-of-evil">Problem of evil</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;14</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-491531" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-491531)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/6b2aa3c6d84547b673c0a30049cbeffd.jpg" alt="Problem of evil" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The connections between the basic impulses and <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">patterns of behavior in my theory</a> are based on pure logic. One of the interesting moments in this system is that the process of creation happens to be present only on the proactive predatory side of the table. You don't just have to be intelligent to create completely new things, you have to be a predator. Not a prey.</p><p>If we assume that our logic holds in the world outside of our universe, the connections between the actions will be the same out there. It means that the theoretical creator of our universe has to behave like a predator as well. And this fact does not depend on any particular flavor of religion.</p><p>Some would say that humans are made in the image of God, although technically it's more like we are all bound by the same logic. It forces the same patterns everywhere. We can all be violent. We can destroy others for our own benefit. It's in our blood. Maybe we don't look as scary as our chimp cousins, but the behavior is practically the same.</p><p>This leads us to the so-called problem of evil. Some people see God as some omnipotent all-loving entity, and this contradicts the observable bad things that happen on Earth. But. All sorts of temptations and destructions come along with creation in the patterns. It's natural. It's not like that person is pure evil, no. It's more like, as criminal profilers say, "capable of".</p><p>Interestingly enough, gods in pagan worlds are seriously biased towards destruction. Looking across Europe, from Ancient Greece to Slavic mythology, we see gods of war, soldiers, hunters, reapers, rulers of the underworld, provokers of natural disasters... Just a few of them seem to be friendly. More or less. If you don't play with them. Most lore around these guys is quite grim. I don't really understand how people got from that to the one and only all-loving hippie God. Human mind definitely works in mysterious ways.</p><p>* This text doesn't have any intentions to offend the believers. Just some direction for theologians to explore.

He can either follow the rules of the group, or rebel against them. The judgement comes from the chosen path.</p><p>Different groups will have different rules. We expect that. It will not be a big problem, as long as you stay with just one group. But there is a much deeper question here.</p><p>Let's say we have a group with some rules and an individual on his own. In order to join, to follow the new moral rules of the group, he needs to have free will. He has to rewire his existing instructions for behavior. To rebel against his past. This is what the group members will expect him to do. To leave the past behind and become one of their own. To become a good person. But once he's there, they will want him to stop. He has to follow their rules and do not change his path ever again. Apparently, it's morally wrong to rebel the second time. He will become a traitor. A sinner.</p><p>This creates a brainwashing paradox of moral responsibility. You need to have free will to join the group of moralists, but you need to lose free will to stay in it. Otherwise you will be constantly bullied by other members of the group for thinking alternative thoughts, asking unwanted questions, and considering actions against their moral rules in general.</p><p>Not every group has this sort of moral pressure, of course. Some groups are open to changes. They are ready to let their members go. However, some groups are almost obsessed with their rules and stability.</p><p>In my theory, I proposed that this loss of free will, loss of the ability to change, is not a good thing. It's a sickness. It's a psychiatric disease that we haven't discovered yet. And these are not just thoughts out of nowhere. I saw some groups of people who do not just judge others all day long, but they repeat each other a lot. They repeat long sentences word by word. They repeat everyday actions. They literally cannot sustain a conversation about anything new. They seem to lose the ability to learn things. The longer you look, the more you see. At some moment it starts to feel like they're not human. It's kind of a creepy thing to observe, actually.</p><p>My point here is that the relations between moral responsibility and free will seem to be complicated. I even start to think that we don't treat the lack of free will as a separate disease just because a lot of societies in our world want to see their members not have it. They're being constantly told that it is morally good to follow the flow and be happy.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/scattered-morality">Scattered morality</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;10</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-343217" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-343217)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/da3e17d4daa664da7f3753d9aa637079.jpg" alt="Scattered morality" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Values. Virtues. Priorities. Morality. Where do all these things come from? Looking from the perspective of the <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a>, we expect to see two kinds of values: personal and collective.</p><p>Personal values come from the patterns of behavior. If something supports the pattern, it is good. If something stops the pattern, it is bad.</p><p>We expect to see a unique set of personal values for every pattern of the class I. Some of them can be combined within the patterns of the class II. Some of them contradict each other in diseases. These personal values change when the individual switches to another pattern of behavior.</p><p>This kind of evaluation, what's good or bad, does not require any intelligence to be used. It comes from the alignment of the upcoming events with the patterns. No rules to create here. Little kids and animals seem to use this kind of values. They don't need to be taught what's important. They already know. This is the most primal kind of judgement. The inevitable one.</p><p>Collective morality is different. It is a set of created rules. We need intelligence to create and follow the rules. Those little kids and most animals will have problems with them.</p><p>Created rules are not connected to the fixed patterns of behavior anymore. We expect to see the variety of them being invented, changed, and discarded through history. Naturally, different social groups will have different sets of created and shared rules.</p><p>There is no such thing as universal objective morality. Personal values from one pattern will inevitably contradict the values from some other patterns. Created rules will follow the interests of different individuals and groups, and will contradict the rules created by their neighbours.</p><p>There are ways to balance the collective interests to some degree. However, the personal pattern-based values are fixed. The only way to change them is by switching patterns. But we cannot make all men use just one pattern for a long period of time. We need different patterns to sustain and develop civilization. This is the curse that humanity has to deal with. And all those theoretical alien civilizations will have the same problem as well. Actually, this can be a sad solution to the Fermi paradox. We are all doomed to never work together efficiently. And to colonize the universe we have to do that.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/architect-mindset">The architect's mindset</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;06&nbsp;/&nbsp;28</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-493457" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-493457)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e417661de1e956270ec6980fbb2b85d8.jpg" alt="The architects mindset" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Let's imagine we're architects. We have a task to design a machine, a replicant, that will mimic human behavior. Or some animal. Let's say we have a "free will" module. We can plug it into the replicant. But. What is the functional role of this module?</p><p>The average answer to this question in my environment is that this module gives the replicant the ability to rebel. To give a finger. To go outside the path that was prepared for him. Burn the bridges. Do things in his own way. If you provide him a 50/50 choice to press a left or right button, he will give you a finger and he will not press any of them. Without this module, he will be a robotic slave, repeating the same instructions over and over. Following the master's orders. With it, the replicant will always have the alternative options to consider in his decision-making unit.</p><p>To perform its role, the module has to be connected to the memory mechanism. It is supposed to extend or override the saved instructions, how to behave, with something outside of that memory.</p><p>First, this means that the "free will" module can work only with the systems of specific complexity. You need a memory mechanism to be present and filled with instructions. At least a read-only memory. Atoms don't have it. Stars don't have it. Human has. Dog has. Replicant will have.</p><p>Second, the "free will" module, by its design, leads to the alternative contradictory processes inside the replicant. They will be destructive either to his memory, or some other parts, including the complete self-destruction, or to his environment. The additional self-preservation module will help to balance things out in the long run. Also, this "free will" module is not the one that will make the replicant follow the same rules for a long period of time. Including the moral rules. We will have to add another module for that.</p><p>From the perspective of the architects, it doesn't really matter how exactly this module will work inside, as long as it fulfills its functional role. We can put the true randomness inside. It can be some determined but unpredictable system. It can be an antenna that receives a stream of data from the other side of the universe. Engineers will provide us options. As long as this mechanism is not being controlled directly from the memory of the replicant, it will work. It will make the replicant rebel.</p><p>The point of this passage is not to talk about the free will specifically, but to point a finger at the mindset that seems to be lacking in the western field of philosophy. Think like an architect. Think about systems. Modules. Functional roles. Connections. Use cases. Generalized patterns. This is the way to see the big picture, even if you don't possess the final engineering details. This mindset helps to bring different concepts together and to guide the further research, instead of producing all these endless debates that don't lead to any new information whatsoever.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/freedom">Freedom</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;06&nbsp;/&nbsp;01</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-565056" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-565056)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/bd85f0d1818cc1ef812041c3c70070fd.jpg" alt="Freedom" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Free will. I use it in my work. Never questioned it. But it seems like in the western philosophy people talk a lot about determinism. They have arguments against freedom. So I asked myself, why our ideas look so different?</p><p>During my childhood, I got two perspectives, two ways of seeing the freedom. One from the Eastern Orthodox Church, and another one from the local pagans and occultists.</p><p>Pagans believe in chaos. We come from it. We return to it. It is home. It is freedom. The absolute freedom. And even when we stuck in the limited material body, we still carry a piece of chaos inside. This is our nature. This is who we are. By embracing the chaos, we get the freedom to do anything. To change the world. I like this position. There is something in it.</p><p>Christians believe in the same chaos, but they associate it with sins. They agree that we all have it inside, but they say it's dangerous. It's like a spiritual sickness. It makes you do stupid things. You'll get hurt by following it. This is not the kind of freedom, that would be wise to have. They talk about the self-preservation a lot, actually. They give you a list of things that you're supposed to do to survive and protect your kin. They may call it a God's will. The right way to be. Whatever. They appreciate, when you exercise your will, and work hard according to these rules.</p><p>Both parties agree, that we do include some chaos inside us, some freedom to do things, but they have different opinions on what we should do with it. Some say we should embrace the chaos and do things just because we can, and some say we should work to control it, and preserve ourselves. This duality stuck very deep in my head, and, apparently, it got reflected in my work.</p><p>In the English-speaking world, at least in the debates on YouTube and Reddit, people are greatly influenced by Protestantism. They talk a lot about the faith, grace, and divine things, that generally happen on their own. They don't really talk about the chaos, and they don't talk about your personal actions that make the difference. You just need to have faith and the universe will take care of everything else. Psychological determinism fits quite naturally in this cultural environment. Things had been set for you already. You will not change anything. Freedom is an illusion.</p><p>I won't make any conclusions here. We don't have enough data to completely prove determinism, or to prove it wrong. These are just some thoughts on the cultural differences that may affect the behavior and our philosophical views.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/religion">religion</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/alchemy">Alchemy</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;06&nbsp;/&nbsp;01</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-591156" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-591156)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/d59fec68d699de9ffba75c39172f4543.jpg" alt="Alchemy" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Right now I'm working on the second part of my crazy project. I use the <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a> as a guide to reinterpret and reconnect the available data from the worlds of neuroscience and psychiatry.</p><p>Everything looks promising so far. Various facts are being attached to the central model of the theory without any conflicts. But it's a long run. The model still can be wrong. And I worry, that even if everything works as expected, we will hit the wall at some moment. The available data is not unending. It's too soon to say anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, I got a question in my head. Is this science? The project itself. Or it's more like an alchemy of sorts. Playing dice with the devil, looking for the ancient wisdom lying in the plain sight, with a goal to find the cure to all diseases?</p><p>On the one hand, I make observations, use the information from the scientific journals, make hypothesis, test them, set up experiments, use all sorts of data analysis techniques, and get other professionals to review things. At the current second stage the project looks more and more like a "proper science".</p><p>On the other hand, it's like a house of cards. The basement of it, the theory of behavior itself, is essentially derived from the highly subjective observations from the mental patients and priests from various religions. Of course, it's not only that, but still. A lot of things in the very core of it cannot be properly measured at this moment. We need them to construct the mechanical model that connects the patterns of behavior and diseases, and it kind of works, but we have to assume some things without any solid proof. This makes the whole thing not 100% scientific. Or, better to say, 0% scientific. It's quite an interesting situation.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">The evolutionary theory of behavior</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;03&nbsp;/&nbsp;14</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="1080" width="1920"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-678891" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-678891)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/df8775320defaf79dcd42066dc4f04df.jpg" alt="The evolutionary theory of behavior" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>In the fields of psychiatry, psychology, we have a lot of problems right now. The causes of the diseases are not really determined. The symptoms are vague and hard to differentiate. The treatments often look like an alchemy. Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Who knows. Maybe another will work. Or not. The psychological theories allow some very loose interpretations, where the chemical processes behind the processes in the psyche should be very precise. In the world of neurochemistry, we have a lot of scattered pieces of information, but they do not explain how all these things work together.</p><p>We definitely need some fresh eyes. So I started the project, that is supposed to bring the new approaches, the new ways to interpret the collected information in the world of psychaitry. I use the ideas from the completely different fields, from the ancient philosophy to the modern computer science and engineering, to shake things a bit.</p><p>The first part of the project was published as the <a href="/evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a>. This is a theory that connects the parts of the psyche, the basic impulses, the observable patterns of behavior, the diseases and the effects in the social groups, attaching everything to the one purely mechanical model.</p><p>The second part of the project is the search for this model, or the similar one, in the field of neurochemistry. Instead of trying to explain every little fact on its own, I look for the similar graph of connections between things. My main hypothesis is that if we can connect things from the outside, the similar graph of connections should be somewhere on the inside. If we find it, it will show us the exact places where the diseases begin. This is a long shot. I know. But it is worth trying.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/publications">publications</a></li><li><a href="/tag/books">books</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article></main> <nav> <h2>Search for:</h2> <br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/emotions/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">emotions&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/evolution/" style="font-size: 122.41379310344827%">&starf;&nbsp;evolution&nbsp;(41)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/free_will/" style="font-size: 87.24137931034483%">free_will&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/intelligence/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">intelligence&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/language/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">language&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/memory/" style="font-size: 90.34482758620689%">memory&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/methodology/" style="font-size: 89.3103448275862%">methodology&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/morality/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">morality&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/philosophy/" style="font-size: 97.58620689655172%">philosophy&nbsp;(17)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/psychology/" style="font-size: 95.51724137931035%">psychology&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/religion/" style="font-size: 83.10344827586206%">religion&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/schizophrenia/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">schizophrenia&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> <br><br>+<br><br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/animation/" style="font-size: 140%">animation&nbsp;(58)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/books/" style="font-size: 88.27586206896552%">books&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/canvas/" style="font-size: 110%">canvas&nbsp;(29)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/codepen/" style="font-size: 155.51724137931035%">codepen&nbsp;(73)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/css/" style="font-size: 119.3103448275862%">css&nbsp;(38)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/github/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">github&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/habrahabr/" style="font-size: 108.96551724137932%">habrahabr&nbsp;(28)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/html/" style="font-size: 111.0344827586207%">html&nbsp;(30)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/javascript/" style="font-size: 141.0344827586207%">javascript&nbsp;(59)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/linux/" style="font-size: 81.03448275862068%">linux&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/math/" style="font-size: 99.65517241379311%">math&nbsp;(19)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/music/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">music&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/photography/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">photography&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/podcast/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">podcast&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/publications/" style="font-size: 113.10344827586206%">publications&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/svg/" style="font-size: 103.79310344827587%">svg&nbsp;(23)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/webgl/" style="font-size: 100.6896551724138%">webgl&nbsp;(20)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> </nav> <footer>Copyright &copy; Ivan Bogachev 2016-2025</footer> <script>const images=document.querySelectorAll("img");images.forEach(e=>{e.complete?e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0):e.addEventListener("load",()=>{e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0)})})</script> <script src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script> </body> </html>
