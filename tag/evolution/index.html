It's true.</p><p>Associations. They may look differently, depending on your technical design, but their role is to connect other sequences. These are like edges of the graph of memories.</p><p>Rules. These are like instructions for reasoning and behavior, based on one-directional associations. It's your program.</p><p>Patterns. We save them as symbols and build an <a href="/post/internal-world">internal world</a>.

Yes, it may sound odd outside of the IT world, but that's the fact. Programs in our computers don't speak, but they work with all these things.</p><p>What happens when we add a language? We add a bunch of facts. Words. We find more patterns for grammar and stuff. We add associations to connect words with our facts and symbols.</p><p>When you walk through your graph of memories, you can grab the words that are connected to your path. Make a sentence. It doesn't have to be grammatically perfect, but you can explain your line of thought to others. But what if your path goes through multiple sequences with no words associated with them?</p><p>Fact can be reproduced as it is. You can draw a picture, make a sound, or whatever your design allows you to do. If your listener has similar experiences, it can be enough to make the right guess. It's not a silver bullet, but it works.</p><p>Associations are easy to explain. Things come together. We connect them. Rules are the same. You can forget why you created some rules, but you can share them with us. If you use transitivity, then just explain everything step by step.</p><p>But what about patterns? If you don't have any words for a symbol or its parts, then you have a problem. It would be practically impossible to explain it. You may share every fact in a symbolic group, but it's highly unlikely that your opponent will find some tricky pattern immediately.</p><p>If you spend some time with data from the same environment, you find a lot of patterns and get a good understanding of it, but there are no words to explain it. Everything works, but you can't share anything.

You save and extract data from your memory. What's next? How to evolve? Try to mix things. Associate sequences of data if they come together.</p><p>Now compare some sequences. Are they identical? Similar? You don't understand anything at this moment, but you can make a rule. A to B. Once you receive a sequence A, find that rule and proceed to B.</p><p>Do you have any free will in your pockets? Use it. Override your instructions for behavior with new rules. You can create rules and follow them. You got a tiny bit of intelligence. Congratulations! You're a genius bacteria! It's time to <a href="/post/the-magical-number-6">increase your cache</a> and play with more complex relations.</p><p>Take three sequences. A. B. S. If A = S, and B = S, then A = B. You just learned Euclidean relations. Great. Try to work with parts. If A includes S1 and S2, and B includes S1 and S2, then A = B. We're getting somewhere. Try to compare a lot of sequences. Find a pattern.</p><p>A = B = C = D = E... = S1 + S2 + X.</p><p>What is this? It's a symbol. How do you call it? You don't. You don't speak any languages yet. But you can save it. You can play with sequences of data that exist only in your head, finding patterns in patterns, and creating a symbolic world.</p><p>Patterns and symbols are cool, but you may want to learn fuzzy transitivity as well. If you have a sequence S, it's connected to A, and A to B, then S is connected to B.</p><p>Now you can see a destination of a sequence. Reuse skills with various subjects in a symbolic group. Play with associations. You can build a lot of things, even a fancy conflict-resolving module for your rules, where you wander around the memory graph and find alternative rules for some tricky situation.</p><p>We may be from different species, but we exist in the same environment and have similar sensors. We likely receive similar sequences of data. We find more or less the same patterns and save them as symbols. This is our collective unconscious. By using it, we align our actions even if we don't know each other and don't have any common language.</p><p>Oh, right. We'll need a language. Our internal worlds may be relatively unique, but we associate sequences that come together. One day we'll find a common sequence. A word. An adapter between one of my sequences and one of yours. We can make a conversation now.</p><p>Do you monitor some of your data channels? Yes? So you have a live feed of your... thoughts? You <a href="/post/selfie">observe</a> sequences of data?

They affect our <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">behavior</a>. But how do you technically recognize yourself in data?</p><p>I see a system as conscious if it saves and extracts data in real time. If you stop all data flows, the consciousness goes away. Complex systems may have many data channels connected to their memory. We can see different levels of consciousness, depending on which set of channels is active at the moment.</p><p>If you have a memory, a bunch of sensors, and data channels to connect everything, you may start to react to things in a structured manner. On the lower levels of evolution, where random mutations affect everything, we would expect to see all sorts of odd reactions. They don't have to make any logical sense to us. Natural selection will take care of them.</p><p>If your system is functionally independent from other things, it would be very convenient to mark sensors or channels as internal or external. You get that mutation, sooner or later.</p><p>These are simple binary flags. It definitely works on the level of bacteria. They don't necessarily have enough brains to understand what they're doing in detail, but they collect data and use it to guide their behavior in the environment.</p><p>At this moment your system is aware of the fact that there is you and there is an environment. And it's not the same. This is the most primal version of self-awareness that you can get.</p><p>You would probably say that this is far from our human self-awareness. Yes. But we add more internal sensors and connect data channels in loops. This is where the real magic begins.</p><p>You may observe data extraction from your memory. Now you're aware that you're aware. You can clearly see <a href="/post/selfie">your selfies</a> being used. Some people would probably argue that this is where you get the "real" consciousness and self-awareness.</p><p>If you have intelligence and work with rules, you may observe their creation. You make your own decisions! This data comes from your internal channels. It's yours! It's your will! Philosophers may call this an illusion, in the sense that this will is not free from prior causes, but it's a functional part of the system anyway. You won't be a human without it.</p><p>New sensors. More loops. More data. More rules. More bizarre effects. Eventually you pass the mirror test. But. It's not a functional self-awareness test. It's an IQ test. It's not enough to distinguish yourself from the environment. That's easy. You need to <a href="/post/the-magical-number-6">work with Euclidean relations in your data to pass the mirror test</a>. We have to be aware of that.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/intelligence">intelligence</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/coordinate-system">Coordinate system</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;15</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-33448" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-33448)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/cced063e2155d599acd6315644e11e6f.jpg" alt="Coordinate system" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>We suffer from a <a href="/post/99-languages">99 languages problem</a>. Let's take free will for instance. One word. But. Psychologists may say that you use it to change your life. Physicists say it's impossible. Politics say it exists, but we don't want you to have it. Priests argue about freedom from god and mortal sins. Philosophers... you know, philosophers. It's a kindergarten. Every boy says that he is the real man and knows the truth.</p><p>In every field people look at the same universe. They just have different coordinate systems. We should be able to use geometric transformations to move all data into one system.</p><p>It's not just a simple linguistic translation word to word, but a projection, system to system. We can keep most of the relationships between data points and make a coherent picture using data from several fields simultaneously.</p><p>All coordinate systems should be interchangeable in our context. We can make a choice using our aesthetic preferences alone, but some options will be more convenient in practice.</p><p>For example, in physics, we have an axis from determinism towards randomness. It's hard to work with it. Data tends to be stretched between two extremes. It's either "pretty sure it's determined" or "pretty sure it's not". Our computers don't have enough precision to work with things in between.</p><p>It looks like you need free will to get away from determinism, but then you are immediately thrown into randomness. We can't work efficiently with complex models of reality in the middle.</p><p>If we get some inspiration from pagans, we may choose another axis, from order to chaos. It's similar, but it's not the same one. Data appears on our screens in a different shape.</p><p>You need the same free will to get away from order, but instead of two extremes we clearly see a spectrum. Some things can be more structured or more chaotic. We can work with that.</p><p>Wills look like proper forces now. They push you along the axis, free will in one direction and will to live in the opposite one. We see how they <a href="/post/path-of-order">affect our society</a>, how do you use them to <a href="/post/make-a-choice">make choices</a>, how do you <a href="/post/architect-mindset">actually build them</a>, why people may <a href="/post/freedom">see them differently</a>, etc. Everything suddenly works. We can compare our notes and make new theories.</p><p>Of course, every boy in the kindergarten will say that this is not the real free will and chaos is not true randomness. Exactly! That's the whole point. This approach is a cosmic compromise. It moves everything in one place and helps to see the big picture. We need it to build new things. Then you can project data back to your home field and use it in the "right" way.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/travelers">Travelers</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;12</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-311674" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-311674)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/d773650709c330d3636e28634fa39e99.jpg" alt="Travelers" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The tree of evolution is gigantic. How do we work with it? We choose a place to start, and travel along the edges from there.</p><p>There are two distinct ways of traveling that may show us the process of evolution of matter from different perspectives.</p><p>We can choose some place and just walk around. This is what biologists do. They choose some organism and follow it. Mutation happened? We go that way. New environment? Turn over there! Predators ate your test subject? Ouch. Next one!</p><p>We may see increasing complexity or decreasing one. We can walk in circles. We observe minor mutations, gradual changes, and collect data with great precision.</p><p>We can study non-living systems in the same way. And produce never-ending debates about the borders between life and not life. Technically, the biological evolution, as we know it, is a special case. There are identical processes in different fields. We just may have a personal interest in this one.</p><p>Alternatively, we can travel from the center in a straight line. We'll have a constantly increasing complexity, evolution in a general sense, but no good subjects to follow. It's more like a theoretical travel across our data.</p><p>Subatomic particles. Self-replication. Single-celled organisms. Don't forget the big things. Stars. Planets. Ocean here. Volcano there. We get ecosystems. Predators eat prey. Machines collect data. And, eventually, we meet an alien civilization with nuclear reactors, space rockets, holy wars, and toilet humor.</p><p>This process is the same travel across the same tree, as with biological evolution. We fly at the speed of light in one direction, instead of passively orbiting around some particular subject, but we look at the same universe.</p><p>Since we have to travel fast to cover everything, we lose precision. We don't see species-specific details, but get the opportunity to study the universal patterns instead.</p><p>Major physical limitations. Logic. Energy conversion cycles. Inevitable structural parts in various systems. Invariants in behavior. Predefined sets of diseases. The longer you look, the weirder it gets. Patterns are literally everywhere.</p><p>There is no right or wrong here. Both ways of traveling have their roles in the development of the theory of everything. We need both the big picture and the fine details. Our knowledge is an organism in the same tree at the end. Combine it. Mutate it. Just don't lead it to extinction.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/selfie">Selfie</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;11</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-30910" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-30910)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/9e6948dc12b7fe7cfb9409bb3105d4ef.jpg" alt="Selfie" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>I'm more interested in answering the question "how the machine works?" first, rather than speculating on "how it sees itself?" with no blueprints on hand. But there are some limitations to the process that we can predict for any system. Let's dive into that.</p><p>In order to save any picture of anything, we need a memory mechanism. Then we add sensors to collect data and channels to transfer it into that memory. Once an image is created, we can use it.</p><p>Sometimes we have degenerate cases, like where the sensor and memory are located in the same place and we could say that the channel has zero length. Think about a film camera.</p><p>But, technically, that's it. We don't need much to save data. Later, we'll need a processor to process everything, but not right now.</p><p>If a system has sensors to scan itself, it'll be able to make a selfie. And yes, if we have enough energy, we can make this work for every part of it.</p><p>Series of snapshots of sensors and data channels allow us to monitor things. Ideally, it's a more or less real-time log of everything that happens with data in the system.</p><p>Logs constantly accumulate. In the real world we may have recent copies, but we don't save all logs from the beginning of time. We'll need to constantly add more storage for that.</p><p>Snapshots of data in memory can be done as well. But again, we can't create a full copy of a storing device and save it in itself. It'll not fit. We can make a partial image. By saving these images, we create a history of some part of the system.</p><p>Most likely we don't have sensors for everything. This means that our logs and snapshots include just some part of the story. There are things that we don't see. It's expected.</p><p>On average, people associate data in recent logs with consciousness and qualia, data in history with self-identity, and data in unmonitored channels with unconscious.</p><p>Some would say that our hardware is a material body and data is an immaterial soul. We definitely have some functional differences here. However, data is the same matter or energy as everything else, so this is just poetry, not physics.</p><p>Logs and snapshots show us events in the past. Looking at them, the system sees itself not only partially, but always has outdated information as well. And it doesn't depend on how the observer module actually works.</p><p>How do you see yourself in this situation?</p><p>Are you the selfie, or the system that looks at its selfie?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/intellectualization">Intellectualization</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;09</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-396898" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-396898)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/f001cf3d6a8ce7498dfc8a9f1a2a4c6a.jpg" alt="Intellectualization" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Emotions are a <a href="/post/and-how-does-that-make-you-feel">signaling part</a> of the self-diagnosing system. Normally, you connect it to the decision-making unit and pass data to it. If that unit doesn't use this data, some will call it an intellectualization. It's like a defense, but the symptoms aren't specific. The causes can be different.</p><p>First situation. Your system works fine, but your resources are limited. You need to be efficient. In this case, you may play with priorities and mark some data as not important.</p><p>This is what they teach you to do in traditional martial arts. You're aware of your status, but you don't use that data to make decisions at the moment. Good news or bad ones. It doesn't matter. Keep the balance. You need intelligence here.</p><p>Second situation. You got an overamplified signal in the system. It can easily fry your decision-making unit. Your fuses stop it automatically. No intelligence. Just a fuse.</p><p>You lose all data from some part of your system. It's not because you created a logical rule to ignore it, but because your safety system got triggered. Your data can still be there, but you can't get to it until your fuses reset. You may measure tension in the system and feel isolated in some sense.</p><p>Third situation. Your system lost energy. This is what we expect to see in schizophrenia, when the completely opposite processes annihilate each other and constantly waste energy.</p><p>You have to cut power in some places. Self-monitoring system is optional, so you can safely shut it down and keep the main system running. Your fuses are intact. You don't have any rules to ignore data. You just don't have any data for now.</p><p>Interestingly enough, sick people, who understand that some system doesn't work and adapt their rules in advance, can be suspiciously stable in catastrophic environments. Everybody around is getting overloaded and confused and they don't.</p><p>Also, there is a fourth scenario, where the physical damage to data channels prevents you from using information. It's a whole new level of problems, but it gives us similar results.</p><p>These situations look almost identical from the outside. You use your upper brain and you don't get unbalanced by data of the specific type. It's easy to accidentally see them as one.</p><p>Next time you blame somebody for being not emotional enough, pay attention to details. Not every person is identical, and the most popular second scenario for intellectualization doesn't require intelligence at all. Keep that in mind.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/compromised">Compromised</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;08</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-684601" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-684601)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e70fefdb80718e78fa6e4aa42dc5c365.jpg" alt="Compromised" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>In <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">my theory</a>, I mentioned memory hallucinations. They're often perceived as a part of schizophrenia, and I argued that it's an independent problem. But that's just a drop in the ocean.</p><p>At the current stage of the project, I reconnect data sets from various books and papers, and I see that the word "hallucination" is being used for many different things. It leads to serious problems in classifications of disorders, not only behavior-related ones.</p><p>Let's take a look at our system from above. There are four parts with different functional roles: sensors, data channels, memory, and processors. Depending on your design, you may have many of them connected to each other or working in parallel.</p><p>If we have a malfunction in the sensor, wrong data is entering our system. This is the first type of problem.</p><p>If the data channels are compromised, we expect to see anomalies in the data flows inside the system. We can measure delays in receiving data, phase shifts, lost signals, amplitude changes, or something like that.</p><p>Also, we can imagine man-in-the-middle attacks, where multiple channels are being physically reconnected in an unusual manner, and some data leaks into the wrong channel.</p><p>If the processes in our memory lose synchronization, we experience true hallucinations that look like dreams, effects like deja vu, and dissociative disorders.</p><p>All these issues with data in memory can happen in a healthy system if you force it to skip its maintenance cycle. They're not necessarily caused by damage to the mechanism itself. If you destroy it, you'll lose data, obviously, but most phenomena here require hardware that actually works.</p><p>If the processor misinterprets data, we get wrong results in our calculations. It can be a poorly protected algorithm, consistently failing to process some particular piece of data, or physical damage that leads to random mistakes.</p><p>For centuries, scholars mixed all sorts of problems with data under the same word. Hallucination. Usually they're organized by data type and the corresponding sensors.</p><p>It's an expected issue. At first, we pay attention to the observable effects. With time, we collect more data on the causes and replace our naive classifications with more precise ones. It's a part of the process. But our data can become very dirty during the transition period. We experience this right now in psychiatry. Some data just smells bad. Be careful.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-ghost-within">The ghost within</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;07</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-459279" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-459279)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/89e782e408643e919b39a28cb78805eb.jpg" alt="The ghost within" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The concept of inner child is one of the mysteries of psychology. It's there, but you can't measure it. It affects you, but maybe not. You can interact with it, but not shoot it dead. It's not a child, but a ghost of a child.</p><p>From our perspective, there is only one object that fits the profile. A part of the memory graph that was constructed relatively long ago and includes at least one rule.</p><p>The main problem here is that the rule itself and the data that was a reason to create it are two separate things. If you delete the rule and keep the data, it's not a problem, but if you lose the data, but keep the rule, then you get yourself a ghost rule. A rule with no reason to be there.</p><p>People who use the same patterns of behavior for their whole lives may never think about these things. You ain't need no inner child to be a man! It's because all their rules point them more or less in the same direction.</p><p>Some people may want to switch to another pattern. It's not a problem, but you need to update the rules. Some of them are universal. Language. Basic skills. Profession. But some rules may be connected to a specific pattern that you've used before. It's time to delete them.</p><p>But if some rule doesn't have a reason to exist anymore, it would be hard to evaluate how important the rule is. For some it will feel safer to keep it intact. This is the way to get stuck between patterns, not using your full potential with the new ones.</p><p>Usually, the concept of inner child comes into play in relation to <a href="/post/trauma">trauma</a>, but it looks like the trauma is a special case. Old rules exist in your memory regardless of your patterns. Clients in therapy will never cover the whole variety of possible behaviors, but it should be obvious that one becomes a prey only because there are predators out there. They may have rules, not related to traumas, but the same conflict inside.</p><p>The most popular way to deal with ghosts from the past in folklore is giving them what they want. Apparently, this is the technique of choice for many therapists these days. Take your inner child and fulfill his needs. No, it's not magic!</p><p>It kind of works. But you have to be careful. Your goal is to destroy what's left of the old pattern. Not to encourage it. Be not afraid to burn things. There is no such thing as "true self" to lose here. There are old rules and new rules. If you got two incompatible rules, you just choose one and stick with it. This is who you are. For now. One day you'll become a ghost yourself and will haunt the future you.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/path-of-order">Path of order</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;05</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-545832" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-545832)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ec407c9a2bb4c588b7f35438259b8232.jpg" alt="Path of order" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>People in different groups may have <a href="/post/scattered-morality">conflicting values</a>, but in all cases we create rules to preserve what's important for us. Also, we need resources. We have to protect our society from direct destruction, but keep it refueled at the same time.</p><p>For every danger, we're trying to find a counterbalance that would be strong enough to stop it, but not too strong. We need to keep access to our resources. It's a tricky balance.</p><p>If you build a village in the middle of a desert to protect it from fire, your folks will have problems with hunting and foraging. If you put everybody in prison for minor violations, you'll have no workers to run your factories. If you reject all scary technologies, you'll likely have to spend more time doing your job in an old-fashioned way.</p><p>In management, we have to choose between weak control with more resources and strict control with fewer resources. In many cases you'll have a tempting choice to do things against the rules, off the record, to get something inaccessible.</p><p>Interestingly enough, determinists often reference the experiment with judges. If they eat well, they are more likely to vote for minor punishments, and vice versa. More resources come together with less control.</p><p>But all these rules for preservation and trials have nothing to do with human agency, or whatever you'll call it. We easily create rules for other species, for machines, for everything we have. When we evaluate the danger that comes from some subject, we think about our preservation, but not metaphysics.</p><p>What we can do, if a subject has intelligence, is to check the rules in his memory. If he has the rules to violate our rules, we get rid of him. If he doesn't have any rules to violate our rules, we may have a discussion. We can use his resources for our own benefit. Or not. We may have a rule to not negotiate.</p><p>You don't need an absolute god-like free will that violates all laws of physics to work with rules and order. Even in the world of machines, they may have tasks for self-preservation and resources to manage. There is nothing supernatural here.</p><p>However, free will in a more grounded sense, like the mechanism that mutates data in memory, is important. A subject that possesses the ability to change his own behavior has a great risk of becoming a rebel and destroying our system from the inside. And it doesn't matter if he uses his own agency or has some predetermined instructions to bring the cosmic chaos on our heads. He has enough freedom to cause problems anyway.</p><p>Will you vote to lock him away in advance to protect the order?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/updating-memory">Updating memory</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-703225" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-703225)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/c7eb0a18085976d703464bcf41aa5cb0.jpg" alt="Updating memory" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>What happens when you update data in your memory? It's a complex process. It takes some time, and there are distinct stages in it that can be important for us. Let's take a look.</p><p>First. You got a new piece of data. It's in your system, but it's not yet connected to anything in the main graph of memories. Updates in the real world are not instant. There is some lag to expect. In many cases you have to proceed with your tasks with slightly outdated information. Psychologists will call this "denial". You have data, but you don't use it.</p><p>Second. The process of updating has started. Now you have conflicts in memory. Some new connections were added. Some old data is still there. It's a mess. Usually, in computer systems, we avoid any actions at this stage. Operations with partially updated memory tend to destabilize everything. It's safer to stop and wait. In terms of psychologists, it's like a state of "bargaining". There are potential conflicts inside.</p><p>Third, the process finished. Your memory is up-to-date. You're good to go. This is what you would probably call "acceptance".</p><p>These three stages of the process are absolutely inevitable. Every heartless machine has them. But your system, depending on its design, may or may not have additional signals for self-diagnosing and internal synchronization.</p><p>Before the first stage, you may get a signal from your inputs that the update is required. It's a kick-starter. A flash. It doesn't last long. We may call this a "surprise", "shock", or whatever word feels more suitable for the circumstances.</p><p>Before the second stage, you already have the data, and you may evaluate the resources required for the update and further actions. At this point you may get a bunch of signals all over the system that order the parts of it to redirect energy. A lot of things happen simultaneously. Priorities change. Some subsystems lose resources. We may call this "frustration".</p><p>Before the third stage, you may diagnose the system again to see how much resources you've spent and what's left. You may need this data to plan your further survival. In human terms it's either "relief", or "tiredness", or something like that.</p><p>Psychologists often describe the stages of grief in a similar fashion. The main issue is that they tell you what we see, but not what happens. In the result, you can get various poetic word plays that are very hard to test. But when you look from the inside, you see the inevitable parts of the process. And they're not about your feelings, really. Every one of them has a purely engineering reason to be there.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/compensation">Compensation</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-762849" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-762849)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/b9c9cec640bef57eab2f394c20259849.jpg" alt="Compensation" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Life is a game of incomplete information. We make decisions using the data we have. We approximate our future all the time. And this process heavily depends on our knowledge.</p><p>In math, it's highly unlikely that you'll guess the curve looking at one point. Even two of three points will leave you clueless. With ten points your guesses become more precise. You still can fail spectacularly, even with hundreds of them, but more points increase the chances of making the right guess.</p><p>The same happens in life. You imagine something using a limited set of data. Then you learn more and realize your... It's not a mistake. No. Let's call it "unlucky guess". You can miss just a bit, or get something completely opposite to reality.</p><p>You're intelligent. Any guess, any choice, leads to the creation of new rules. You continue to add more data to the graph of memories using these rules. Your whole personality shifts somewhere. It's our nature. We constantly change.</p><p>If some choice affects a lot of things in your life, the accidental shift can be dramatic. Some would see it as a compensation. Like you got a small problem and decided to run from it in the opposite direction. However, I would argue that this is not a defense. It's just a premature guess that leads to unplanned big changes. A butterfly effect, if you will.</p><p>Psychologists often talk about healthy and unhealthy compensations. This evaluation relies on the environment and collective morality, but everything <a href="/post/relative-irrationality">is relative</a>. Prey could easily say that predatory behavior is a bad compensation for some insecurities. Don't forget that our closest cousins in the wilderness eat raw meat. We were never designed to be wimps by default. Different patterns of behavior have reasons to exist, even if they look bad to your eyes. Biology and subjective morality are not the same. Don't rush your verdicts about the healthiness of changes.</p><p>Personality shifts are harmless on their own. However, dissonances in data are expected to appear when you learn more things after a big turn. Your brain will have to fix them, remove some rules and tune some numbers to compensate for over or under estimations. It takes time, but it's a <a href="/post/make-it-black">natural process</a> of data invalidation. Nothing to worry about.</p><p>But if you get a disease that allows contradicting patterns of behavior to appear, any shift may become a problem. Your brain will not delete data if it's being actively used. If you have two conflicting processes that utilize incompatible pieces of information, the dissonance may stay there until you resolve the logical conflicts and keep just one process running.</p><p>Fixing the primary disease should be a top priority. Otherwise, you'll have a constant memory of living somebody else's life.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/wrong-tool-for-the-job">Wrong tool for the job</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;03</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-52576" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-52576)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/6f6a5f2115551bedfe5dd268d219d6eb.jpg" alt="Wrong tool for the job" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>One of the main tricks in my theory is breaking a pattern. It's a very straightforward action on its own, but it feels like there is one nuance that needs to be elaborated.</p><p>Every pattern of behavior of class I includes impulses from three systems out of four. One is missing. When we're trying to stop some loop, it doesn't make much sense to appeal to something that is not connected to it.</p><p>For example, patterns (1), (5), (9), (13). The first column of our table. They don't utilize intelligence. Individuals will not react to any logical reasoning. They won't stop just because you have good arguments. They may react to the changes in the environment, new temptations, or something that affects their will to live. But serious discussions are a waste of time.</p><p>Chimp, turning aggressive because all females ignore him (1), can change his mind when he gets attention. Gladiator (5) may stop if he loses feedback. Don't feed the troll! You can even unbalance highly adaptive ones (9) by taking their ability to ignore things. You can change the environment, play with choices against something, or even use blind force, but have you ever tried to reason with any of these characters? It's hard. It just doesn't work. It's the wrong tool for the job.</p><p>The loops in the second column, (2), (6), (10), (14), don't utilize free will. If you tell these individuals that they can just try something new, they'll not listen. They're not ready to explore possibilities and make big decisions on their own. Adapt. They use their brains. You can make an argument. Just don't suggest them jump off the cliff right from the beginning. Start small.</p><p>The third column, (3), (7), (11), (15), is not connected to will to live. These ones will not care about the risks in the long run. The last column, (4), (8), (12), (16), is not connected to the environment. You'll not stop these loops by changing external circumstances. Every column has one thing that is not there. Interact with the others.</p><p>To guide behavior, we stop one pattern and help to use another one. All these thoughts can be applied to it as well. Don't waste resources on supporting something that's not connected to the desired pattern. Be efficient. Concentrate on one thing and push it to the end.</p><p>In many approaches in psychology, one trick is being used for everything. But this is not the case. Every column has its unique features. Every pattern is different. You have to be intentional and precise. The table can be used as a cheat sheet. It should help.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/make-a-choice">Make a choice</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;09&nbsp;/&nbsp;02</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-375044" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-375044)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/eadeb6a6576911c25b0316240b0ff113.jpg" alt="Make a choice" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>We portray our pagan ancestors in folklore as free and prideful men, standing against nature itself and playing with forces far beyond their control. They never kneel. They would better die fighting, rather than accept and obey. They value creativity. They're playing against all odds. They constantly transform themselves and the world. This path of change is dangerous. They pay with blood. But they are free.</p><p>In this context, we may treat freedom and change as almost equivalent things. You don't break free when you choose between the provided options and then argue about things that you could have done otherwise. You need to change the rules of the game. Create a new option that was never given to you. Don't choose the future. Make it. Burn the past and rise from the ashes like a phoenix. Become a new man. Build a new tomorrow.</p><p>These choices may look very personal, because you may associate yourself with your memory, and data from it is being used, but they have to include some things that can't come from the same memory. You need a mutation to happen in your data.</p><p>Depending on how you see yourself, the choices may look truly yours, or not. Many philosophers are flying in circles around the definition of "you" in this equation. As far as I can see, the answer depends on religions and historically affected cultural environments. But regardless of determinism, indeterminism, immaterial souls, or whatever stories you like, the problem reduces to memory and mutations in it.</p><p>If you aim to change your life, you have to let go. Both your past memories and active control. Get all your demons together and cut them loose. Allow chaos to provide you alternative options. Take one that is more or less aligned with the data in your mindset and use it. Just because you can.</p><p>Losing control? It's dangerous! No. No. No. Your will to live goes against your will to freedom. It's stupid. It's anarchy. It's inappropriate. Destroy stability? Take risks? Change everything? Seriously? Don't know what kind of witch made you think that it's a good idea, but we have to get rid of her. Your self-preservation mechanism protects you from changes.</p><p>On the level of societies, we see the same picture. Will to live is being constructed in the form of police, courts, prisons, censorship, etc. It protects the existence of society. But the price is freedom.</p><p>These days many people see freedom not in changes, not in rebellions, but in choosing which TV channel to watch. Some even say they don't have a choice. Maybe you need to remind yourself that you don't choose a choice.</p><p>You make a choice.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/trauma">Trauma</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;29</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-233353" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-233353)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/210bb57f855dd5637bd941f570bad0a0.jpg" alt="Trauma" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Psychologists like the word "trauma". But the definitions are very vague. Maybe we should take a look at the potential problems and help this term mean something more specific.</p><p>First. <a href="/post/make-it-black">Cognitive dissonance</a>. I would argue that it's not a trauma at all. It's a natural process. Nothing is broken. You just need to grab a coffee and wait for your memory to update the data. It's a temporary inconvenience.</p><p>Second. Diseases. Mania. Depression. Catatonia. Schizophrenia. They lead us to internal logical conflicts. There are serious <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">breakdowns in the system</a>. The same applies to anxiety with exaggerated impulses and other diseases. You can't fix rusty valves and leaking tubes by talking about your childhood. I mean, you can ignore the leak, but it's not a real solution.</p><p>Third. Memory about the dangerous environment that pushes you into the patterns (9) or (15). Adapt and ignore, or justify and call for pity. Or both, as a pattern of the class II. This is what I prefer to classify as trauma. It's not just memory. It affects your behavior. And it's not a disease.</p><p>These two patterns are natural ways to behave for prey animals, but some educated and emotional people may not agree. High levels of stress hormones. You miss something. Grass is greener on the other side. You know the drill. But this problem can be solved. You can switch to other patterns. The real danger is in running from a bear through a minefield.</p><p>Let's say you are an adaptive victim (9) + (15). Danger is everywhere. You work on self-awareness and you convince yourself that everything is safe now. Welcome to the pair (10) + (15). Helpless victim. Now you have dread on top of your trauma. Oops. And this pattern is a very confusing one. It's not a broken switch of depression, but an odd combination of danger and safety in an ocean of tears. Not the best choice.</p><p>Maybe, you're a real man. You decide to stop crying. Then you can slip into (9) + (16). Adaptive conformist. Same problem with dread. Your stress hormones won't get lower. Wait. What?</p><p>You can be stuck in this maze for a while, actually. Our chemistry is very inert. It will help you to switch between these patterns back and forth. It's hard to find an exit. Plus, in terms of energy, it's efficient to stick to one pattern. Changes of directions can exhaust you on their own.</p><p>If you want to get out, you need to choose the patterns (11), (12), (13), or (14), or change the side completely and become a proactive predator. Their patterns are based on a different chemistry. But this choice is not for everyone. There will be <a href="/post/relative-irrationality">consequences</a>.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/hidden-knowledge">Hidden knowledge</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;28</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-403107" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-403107)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/d6ad4caada75bff616b26ba11d2d78af.jpg" alt="Hidden knowledge" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Religious texts are often full of metaphors and oversimplified for the sake of a good story. It's ok. Literature is an art. But these books include insane amounts of information about human psychology. I'll give you a few examples.</p><p>Structural parts of the psyche. The id, ego, and superego that we know from psychoanalysis. Actually, they've been with us for millennia. Socrates used to talk about them. Shoulder angel and shoulder devil. Order and chaos. Preservation and change. Will to live and free will. Two forces. Two wills. Two whispering creatures. And "you", stuck in the middle.</p><p>Sensory rooms to help people with psychological problems were invented in the 70s, but you can trace them back at least to the time of witch hunts. Most likely they were with us much longer. I'm just not motivated enough to find the origins.</p><p>Art therapy? The idea that warriors can neutralize their destructive mindsets by making art when going home to family is not new. Many old pagan rituals look exactly like combinations of art therapy with gestalt therapy. We don't call them like that, but the working principles are identical.</p><p>Modern therapists use the same tricks that men of religion used for centuries. They deny this, of course, to look more serious, which is funny, but it's kind of true. And no, I'm not here to criticize. I'm here to whisper.</p><p>The knowledge is there. In the books. Our ancestors collected some data for us. We can use it. We just need to translate everything into the modern language of science. Don't make conflicts between science and religion. Make translations. Poets and scholars look at the same world at the end.</p><p>In physics, we've made a lot of progress in the last few centuries. When everybody around us is getting magical skin burns, we borrow a Geiger counter from radiology and check everything. We don't blame the invisible evil anymore. Old stories are like outdated theories now. Good enough for a cave man, but not to get the GPS on your phone working. We have better stories now, with more precision.</p><p>But in psychology, we still exist on the level of protoscience. We live in the cave. We need to build a stable basement for the field. In our position, it's not wise to discard data just because the authors don't have a PhD.</p><p>Read old books. Listen to folks out there. Test their claims. Combine old approaches with <a href="/post/the-abyss">fresh observations</a>. Utilize every bit of knowledge we have. It doesn't guarantee success, but it's better than reinventing everything on your own.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/religion">religion</a></li><li><a href="/tag/language">language</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/personality-traits">Personality traits</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;25</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-871482" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-871482)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/eebfe917385e11e4e3de39306fcc5875.jpg" alt="Personality traits" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>One of the interesting topics for exploration is connections between personality traits and patterns of behavior. Are they even connected? And, if yes, then how?</p><p>These sorts of data mappings are useful in practice, but I think we have to be careful. All these traits don't define you. They describe you. There is a difference. We assign the words to different observable qualities, but they don't necessarily explain the internal structure of the organism. I will propose a classification that can be used with my theory, but again, it's all about semantics and language.</p><p>The first group of traits comes directly from our 16 patterns of behavior of the class I. When you use the same pattern over a long period of time, people start to associate its parts with you. Creative. Aggressive. Dramatic. These kinds of words describe what you do. They portray your patterns of behavior and should be bound together by the same logic as the basic impulses. We easily apply these words to little kids and our pet animals, since the patterns are universal.</p><p>The second group is about your stability and efficiency. Cool-headed. Purposeful. Committed. Emotional. All over the place. These words don't describe any specific patterns, but provide data on your ability to actually finish whatever you do. Get the job done and not waste the resources. These qualities are very important in competitive environments, where the resources are limited. They're often mentioned in traditional martial arts as something crucial for survival and deeply interconnected with a state of a body. There are some correlations to study in their context.</p><p>The third group includes the rules-based qualities. Idealistic. Principled. Methodical. Pedantic. In some cases they affect your efficiency, in some cases they don't, but what makes them special is that you need to be intelligent and create a lot of rules in your memory to get these traits associated with you. Cultural environment. Education. Previous experience. More rules you learn, more variety you get here. Usually we treat little kids and animals as intellectually inferior creatures and do not apply these words to them in any form.</p><p>The fourth group includes the traits based on your connections with others. They don't describe you in vacuum, but rather add some data on the alignment of your behavior with a group. Selfless. Selfish. Reliable. Unreliable. Cooperative. Uncooperative. These words naturally come in pairs, and they're relative by definition. We're talking about combinations of compatible and incompatible patterns and rules that meet each other for various reasons and do not depend exclusively on your own personality. If you have multiple groups to interact with, then it's very possible that they'll associate the exact opposite traits of this kind with you. And usually we don't apply these words to animals, unless they're seriously involved in our group activities, like hunting dogs.</p><p>What do you do? How stable are you? Any special rules? Answers to these questions describe your overall personality. I'm not sure if we should treat the fourth group of words as personality traits, but they can add more details to the description. Context can be important sometimes.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/relative-irrationality">Relative irrationality</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;22</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-776275" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-776275)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/49eb322fd06dd97d5a9eb8c8f9a81d3f.jpg" alt="Relative irrationality" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Irrational. I avoided this word for a while. It's way too confusing. With a dream to build a replicant that will mimic human behavior, I'm looking for engineering explanations for everything, but irrational thinking is something odd. What is it? How do you build it? Nobody has any blueprints of it. I started to scroll through examples of irrational thoughts and actions with a hope to find some patterns in this mess on my own...</p><p>Constant fear of safety. Perceiving every environment as dangerous. Choices to not do anything and procrastination. Consuming instead of creating. Ignoring. Crying for help when not needed... Wait. No. This looks like the processes on the reactive side of the table. These are patterns of behavior of the prey animals. They don't make any sense for a predator.</p><p>Eventually I got some reversed examples, where the predatory behavior was claimed to be irrational from the perspective of the prey. That's an interesting duality of opinions. Almost like we have two opposing kinds of reasoning, and everybody believes that his reasoning is the rational one.</p><p>It looks like this whole thing is not about you choosing emotions over brains, but about somebody wanting you to be a predator, while you're not one of them, or vice versa.</p><p>This means that the term "irrational" is relative, actually. You're always rational in relation to your own patterns of behavior, but at the same time you can be irrational in relation to the patterns on the other side. In many ways it's like a <a href="/post/scattered-morality">personal morality</a>. It's not universal by definition.</p><p>In mania, depression, catatonia, and schizophrenia, we see combinations of contradicting patterns inside one individual. The behavior goes against itself. These are real conflicts in logic. Most people who are blamed to be irrational do not have anything like that. They're not sick in any way. They just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are being confronted with some expectations.</p><p>Sometimes healthy people may want to switch to other kinds of behavior for some reason. We can help them, but we have to keep in mind that this is not about some minor thoughts. The chemistry of the whole organism will be affected. New behavior will seriously contradict the existing one.</p><p>We expect to see the withdrawal symptoms during the switch. The relationships in the groups will be destroyed. You cannot change a side for real and pretend that nothing happened. It's not just dreams. There will be consequences. You have to burn your old life to build a new one. Not every person out there will be ready to pay the price. It will look like an irrational thing to do.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/where-it-lands">Where it lands?</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;21</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-554124" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-554124)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ff3635c108c08f145cdcfe66b87108e6.jpg" alt="Where it lands?" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The existence of the basic impulses from <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">my theory</a> should be obvious for every person who ever looked at the real people outside. The four parts of the psyche are more of a game of language, rather than a game of logic. They're there to create the right mindset. To show that there are four functional roles to begin with. However, when we <a href="/images/4d198819ade3176ccd510089e6b2c4e4.jpg">connect everything</a>, it may not be obvious why the processes end where they end. Why don't we reconnect them in a different fashion?</p><p>The thing is, the processes start exactly where we placed them, according to their roles, but they end where they have to. It may sound counterintuitive, but they just don't have any options here. It feels like everything should be connected to everything, but every process has its requirements. Their directions are already incorporated in their meanings.</p><p>We need the environment to ignore it. We need somebody out there to call for help. We need to find the supplies in order to exhaust them. We need space to create new things in it. We need the world of things to annihilate them in various ways. Every process here requires an environment. We can make compromises in some other things, but not here.</p><p>Temptation to violate the rules, as well as justification, bending the rules, requires intelligence. We need to work with rules to do these things. Diagnosing and dread require us to operate with rules and consequences. To understand that the environment gives us things we don't deserve, or stops our actions, we have to work with logical rules as well. Every road leads us to the same intelligence. These processes won't work without it.</p><p>The helping environment gives us free energy for new unnecessary actions, while danger suggests us to change our course. Counterbalance, protection, and reconstruction are the ways to go against the naturally happening events. Inaction is a change in some indefinitely working program. Everything here pushed us to other ways of doing things. Again, the processes start differently, but they lead to the same place.</p><p>Adaptation and goal-oriented destruction are two sides of the same blade, pointed in opposite directions. Both can hurt us. Inflexibility leads to conflicts. Indifferent environment means that there is something wrong. These impulses trigger the self-preservation mechanism. The rest of them are on the other side of the coin. They are notifications that there is a pause in action. It's time to heal and recover. The destination is the same.</p><p>We will need to perform some adjustments eventually, polish the wordings to make everything sound better, and grasp the right meanings. Nobody invented all these words to be used in this sort of system. It's a hard linguistic problem, and even the detailed descriptions in the book are not silver bullets, but I hope this explanation will help others to improve this system or build similar models for different processes. Just throw an apple and look where it lands naturally.

On the frontiers of science, demons hide themselves in novelty, but not in complexity. We use Occam's razor and appreciate elegant solutions for our problems.</p><p>In contrast, programmers rarely create completely new things these days, but the complexity of our systems can be overwhelming. We constantly work on the methods to decrease it. This is one of the main topics for debates in the field.</p><p>We use all sorts of design patterns to organize large amounts of code. They help a lot. No need to keep the whole project in your head all the time. But also we have discussions on how to write instructions that would be easy to understand.</p><p>If you have millions of lines of code in the project, the last thing you want is to read every one of them several times to get the logic. You don't write code for machines, you write it for people. By writing simple code you help your colleagues to spend their resources on actual development, instead of solving your puzzles with zero business value.</p><p>When you increase cognitive complexity with no reason, you create technical debt. It gradually slows down the development process. Increases the costs. It can kill the project eventually. There are rare exceptions where we accept dirty code in some utils to get better performance, but they're write-only things. Once they start to work, you leave them alone and never get back.</p><p>Some people used to argue that complex tasks require complex code, or that precision in algorithms makes code dense, or that abstract concepts are hard to understand by their nature, and that you need to grow as a professional to get it. None of this is true.</p><p>The moment we started to introduce the tools for static code analysis, to automatically prevent the obfuscated code from entering our projects, we realized that complex systems can be written in simple language. Of course, you need to learn the basics. You need to know the words. But the code can be easy to understand. When you write intricate code, it's likely not because you actually need it, it's because you choose it.</p><p>When I look at the language in academic publications, I feel like it's much more complex than it should be. Often, I have to read the same sentence many times to understand it. Not because of the subject matter, but because of the language.</p><p>It seems like people use the same arguments to protect this obscure language that programmers used back in the days to protect their bad code. But why?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/language">language</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-devils-game">The Devil's game</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;15</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-47549" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-47549)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/c6135b5dc04911cce97a6d4793b5f526.jpg" alt="The Devils game" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>When we work with data, we don't really think about hardware. In most cases it's absolutely unnecessary. It doesn't matter what kind of materials and processes are present in your computer, as long as it works.</p><p>However, if we put a computer into the environment with high radiation, random events start to happen. You could say that one destroyed molecule in the processor will not affect the program. Most likely not. But if we wait long enough, we get to the point where small destructions accumulate and start to affect the system as a whole. It either stops working completely, or some glitches appear in the program, or in the memory, where the program saves data.</p><p>From the perspective of a program, this is a natural chaos that may or may not damage the system at any given moment. Of course, we can play with statistics. We can say that technically all these small particles and collisions are completely predetermined, but it doesn't matter. The robot knows that it is destined to go into that room with a melted reactor, but only a chance decides if the program will or will not work as expected.</p><p>Even if God doesn't play dice on the level of atoms, the robot still has to play the Devil's game on the level of programs and data.</p><p>When we talk about determinism in behavior, we often limit the path by the genes and the environment - education, family, friends, etc. We often say that some person is destined to end up in some place because all these factors are pushing him there.</p><p>But all these initial constants and environmental factors exist on the level of software. Our sensors don't see what's going on at the lower levels. Things happen, but we don't save them in our memory for further use in the process of decision-making. Some of these hidden events can provide unpredictable alternative options to consider.</p><p>It's funny to observe people talking about fate and destiny when they apply these concepts to individuals who actually choose these random options. They look at your past. They see the causes for everything. They predict your future. But the next day they have to change their tune and say that actually everything leads you to something completely different. And the next day it's something different again. And again, and again, and again.</p><p>I think that we should differentiate the physical determinism and the practical unpredictability of behavior. Past events in our memory are not everything. There is some degree of randomness that exists on its own and may affect our decisions.</p><p>What would you prefer, to stay where you are, correct the errors, discard deviating thoughts, and proceed with your life in an orderly fashion, or to embrace the chaos, play a game of chance, and build a different future?</p><p>The choice is yours.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/fear">Fear</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;14</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-774345" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-774345)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/84322a33ebd4f7b2517936dc57be6532.jpg" alt="Fear" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>You're a little animal. You sit in your forest. It's a warm summer evening. You have your family with you, some food, and a comfortable shelter. Everything is fine. The sun goes down. It's time to sleep. You close your eyes and disappear... No. The forest is way too calm. Something is off. You start to look around. Nothing. Subtle smell of flowers, some fireflies are dancing around. Home, sweet home. You close your eyes. No. No. No. There is a shadow between the trees. Wait. Where is it? Oh, there is another one! You start to see the eyes glazing at you from the darkness. The bugs crawl under your skin. You feel how somebody touches you from behind. You cannot move. You're frozen. The evil poisoned your mind. The primal dread became your second shadow. You cannot fight it. It's in your head. You cannot run away. It's inside you. Some old legends say the fear can kill you. This is it. The end. The only thing you can do is to sit and wait for the inevitable.</p><p>Psychologists tend to use the term "fear" loosely. We often mix completely different things using this word, losing the context, and making therapy less effective. I think that we should be more careful. There are several flavors of fear.</p><p>The first one is a part of the fight-or-flight response, or whatever you call it these days. The bear attacks. You have to do something. Your body prepares for action. It's an immediate reaction that takes a lot of energy. It will not last forever. You need to stop and eat from time to time. Get yourself refueled. In some sense, this reaction is universal for every species and every pattern of behavior. We all have it one way or another. It just looks slightly different, depending on the body design and biases towards proactive or reactive behavior.</p><p>The second type of fear is that dread that makes you stuck. It makes you paranoid without any visible reason. You cannot do anything. Your body doesn't work at all. This fear can last. It doesn't require much energy. It just keeps you alert all night long. In my theory, this sort of fear is deeply interconnected with specific patterns of behavior. Adult apex predators cannot get this reaction at all. It just doesn't fit in their patterns.</p><p>The third type of fear is the rules-based one. It requires intelligence. If you create and follow the rules, then you can acquire a set of rules that makes you avoid something. If you pierce your throat with a fish bone, you'll probably make a rule to avoid that kind of fish in the future. This is different from the first two kinds of fear. It's in your memory. You can make hundreds and thousands of rules for all sorts of subjects and life scenarios. They don't require any energy to be kept in memory, and they can stay with you forever.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-rat">The rat</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;13</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-680337" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-680337)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/80893d33069dce24cd2a564f9d7697e1.jpg" alt="The rat" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Imagine a data center. Steel and glass, endless racks with servers, futuristic blue lights, thousands of hard drives, kilometers of cables, three power sources, ridiculous amounts of information, automatic backups for everything. You sit in your cabinet with eight monitors like a true hacker from that movie. Something is off, isn't it?</p><p>Yes, there is something. A repeating anomaly in some data flows. Sometimes it's there. Sometimes it's not. It's time for an investigation. You open the terminal and the journey begins. Logs, reports, more logs, more reports, some coffee. The logs will never end. You spend hours, days, nights, weeks, trying to locate it. It's there. But where is it? It's in your data, but there is no reason for it to be there. You start to question yourself at some moment. It's true madness. You're chasing a ghost in the net.</p><p>One day some newbie guard is getting lost, walks into a wrong corridor, and finds a big rat chewing on one of your cables.</p><p>The rat!</p><p>You didn't see that coming, did you? Yes, they eat cables. Now you know that. And they're not ghosts, obviously. You got a degree in computer science, but nobody ever told you that sometimes you have to get out of your terminal, stand up, and have a good walk around the building, looking for actual rats.</p><p>But this story is not about those curious animals. It's about the limits of knowledge. Sometimes you cannot catch a ghost because your data is very limited. Very. Limited. You expect to find a solution in your logs, looking for small inconsistencies in numbers, but you don't notice a whole offline world outside. Wake up, Neo. Follow the rat.</p><p>I was thinking about the hard problem of consciousness recently. It looks similar to this situation. We cannot solve it using the available data because we don't notice something really big. It doesn't mean we cannot learn the truth. We just have to get out of our information bubbles.</p><p>But how do we find a conscious rat if we don't know that the offline world exists? Is it possible to make a right guess without any external help? We can create new things by combining and mutating old things, following the process of evolution, but every step depends on the previous steps. It's like a mental trap that doesn't allow us to imagine some things outside of the <a href="/post/is-there-any-other-way">tree of combinations</a>.</p><p>Do we really have to wait for some external entity to make observations and reveal the knowledge to us? It doesn't look like a solid strategy.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/99-languages">99 languages</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;12</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-845529" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-845529)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/c8bc6a035bc2392c496fa728d306e2c5.jpg" alt="99 languages" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Mistakes. We make them. Even my lecture notes for the <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">theory of behavior</a> include some. Apparently, my proofreaders from the IT world with their fancy AI spell checkers are way too tolerant. They're just some spelling bugs. They're annoying. They buzz in your ears. But they do not damage the system itself in any way. We can fix them, or even ignore them, and try to not repeat them ever again. As time goes on, we learn our lessons. The process is straightforward. Learn more rules. Make fewer mistakes.</p><p>Everything works fine. Until it doesn't. It turns out, there are different rules for the same language in different fields. You cannot follow all of them. They contradict each other.</p><p>And I'm not talking about all those complex writing styles that many scientists use for some reason. No. They're easy to balance. Just keep it simple. I'm talking about the words themselves. Sometimes the same word has completely different meanings in different contexts. Sometimes different terms are being used to describe the same thing, hiding the obvious. How do you deal with that?</p><p>You can create a new set of terms for your project. Others will have to learn everything from scratch. It's hard. You can borrow some meanings from one field and force them into some other fields. This creates confusion. No matter what you choose, it's not perfect.</p><p>My current project combines philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, programming, engineering, and now, at the second stage, it also gets biology, neuroscience, and some general physics involved. It's a linguistic mess that haunts the project from the very beginning.</p><p>The philosophical introduction to my theory explains the most important terms. It helps, but it's not enough. There is a whole bunch of IT-related concepts that are obvious to me and my colleagues, but not to some average psychologist or biologist. They use the same words with completely different meanings and everything falls apart in their heads. It starts to look like I need to make a second edition of my notes with ten pages of translations and explanations for every single page of actual theory. It doesn't feel right.</p><p>The academic community seems to avoid this problem, but it's big. We cannot see invariants clearly when the rules of language are messed up. Sometimes scholars spend years to rediscover common knowledge just because they cannot see it in front of them. It's really hard to reuse knowledge, unless you create your own symbolic language to fix the inconsistencies between the fields, but then nobody understands you.</p><p>What should we do? Is it time to stop fragmenting the science and create a universal language, like we do in large companies, to synchronize their business and IT departments?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/language">language</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/make-it-black">Make it black</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-313757" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-313757)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e2740ef71cddebd7004f31984dca3bf7.jpg" alt="Make it black" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>One of the things that can happen in the graph of memories is cognitive dissonance. Memories just don't match each other or some data that comes from the inputs of the system.</p><p>It's not necessarily a bad thing. It happens all the time in every system that interacts with its environment. It changes. Data has to be updated. It takes some time. Meanwhile, some types of bugs can appear in the system. In human terms, you'll feel a bit confused.</p><p>The brain should be able to update the memory graph and remove the conflicts. In dissociative disorders we get lots of wrong connections simultaneously, and the process of recovery becomes tricky, even impossible in some cases, but if you're healthy, then you have nothing to worry about. This dissonance is a temporary inconvenience.</p><p>During traumatic events, you can get a serious dissonance. If you had a person who've been with you for your whole life, that person should be connected to a lot of things in the memory graph. If you lose him, it would take a lot of time to fix the connections. To make them match the world outside. It can become annoying at some point. Usually people start to notice the dissonances only in these harsh circumstances.</p><p>Technically, humor is a way to create small dissonances in controllable conditions. There are fifty shades of humor. The black one is the closest to the things that psychologists may perceive as traumas. But the joke is tiny. It doesn't hit any deep connections in the graph. The brain quickly adapts to the dissonance. It's not disturbing.</p><p>In some sense, black humor is like a vaccine. You get a minor feeling of dissonance in the context of traumatic events. You get comfortable with it. When the time comes, you don't feel too confused. It's not about positive emotions and laughing, but about your ability to sit tight while your brain is working hard to fix the outdated connections in the memory.</p><p>It seems like this is not a very popular opinion in psychological circles, but maybe we should be less serious. And this relates to the academic community as well. Professionals often stick to old theories. It's hard to make a discussion. It's hard to bring new approaches. They feel too confused. Too anxious. Lost. It becomes much easier if you draw the horns on the portrait of grandpa Freud on that wall and ask some silly questions from time to time.</p><p>Make a cup of humor every morning. Make it black. Enjoy it. Open the window. Let the sweet smell of exhaust gases with a fresh note of garbage accompany the beautiful melody of your neighbour's drill. The world can wait.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/to-eat-or-not-to-eat">To eat, or not to eat?</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;01</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-974598" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-974598)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/6758e99a2d2992dbcb0a331d1ecaeddb.jpg" alt="To eat, or not to eat?" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>To eat, or not to eat? That is the question. Or not. Not really, isn't it? The law of conservation of energy suggests that you cannot get energy from nothing, which means that every organism has to include an energy conversion subsystem in it. Every human has to eat. Every mammal. Every living thing. Every alien. Every robot. Every zombie. Everybody. The ways of converting energy can be different, but the process itself has to be there.</p><p>In the context of behavior, we have lots of subsystems and actions to keep in mind. It's overwhelming. However, most of them are universal. They're everywhere. Sometimes they're absolutely necessary for every system in our field. Sometimes they're specific for different species, but every individual in the species does the same thing. We can subtract them from every part of the equation. It allows us to concentrate on the things that actually make the difference.</p><p>This is the reason why I don't include some systems and actions in my work. They're not specific enough. Right now I'm mapping the data from my theory to the human brain, and it looks like the reward system is everywhere. It works in the same way in every pattern of behavior. It cannot explain any choices. It seems to not be connected to any disease in my list. It's just there. Like a universal artifact of human biology. Should we exclude it from the equations? I'm not sure. Probably.</p><p>I would argue that even such an important phenomenon as qualia can be completely irrelevant to the psychology of behavior, because it's all about choices, and the qualia, as we understand it, is a universal artifact.</p><p>It would be interesting to notice that all these things are not really under our subjective control. We don't control our hunger and digestion. We cannot choose to not have qualia.</p><p>In some cases we can disrupt these universal subsystems and processes. This leads to the diseases that we normally treat as non-psychiatric. They can make you less efficient in whatever you do, or completely prevent you from doing things, but you'll not end up in a nuthouse.</p><p>This leads me to thinking that in order to speed things up in the field of psychiatry, we can not only pay more <a href="/post/is-there-any-other-way">attention to the inevitable</a>, but we can cut. We can cut everything that seems to be everywhere. Mercilessly. Cut. Cut. Cut. There are many things in our brains, but only a small amount of them have something to do with choices and psychiatric diseases. Most of them are just there. It's hard to put away something that you have invested in, but maybe it's time.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/broken-timelines">Broken timelines</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;23</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-366754" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-366754)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/dd6e8024a8d553a94a70399c0bb4c4ed.jpg" alt="Broken timelines" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>I did that. Then I did that. Then I don't remember. Then I found myself on the other side of the city. I heard this story many times from the patients with schizo-spectrum disorders in private conversations. Minutes. Hours. Durations can be different, but the story is the same. The main timeline in the memory is broken.</p><p>According to the patients' observations, this problem correlates with bad sleep. It looks like a negative symptom of schizophrenia, but technically seems to be more like a version of the dissociative disorder, added on top of it.</p><p>Previously, I described how we design memory <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">from an engineering perspective</a>. Why do we need sleep? What happens during memory maintenance? How do we get the dissociations? The broken timelines look exactly as we expect the data to look after the malfunctions of this kind. It's one of the possible scenarios. If it's the case, the memories are split, scattered, but not deleted. We can try to recover them.</p><p>We don't save data in one-dimensional data structures that are easy to break into halves, like lists or stacks. They're more like graphs. Many connections are all over the place. If you break the graph during the mentioned memory malfunction, some connections will be lost, but some have all the chances to be preserved. Yes, it depends on the actual storing algorithm. We don't know all the details yet. But it's likely that one minor glitch will not break all the connections at once.</p><p>This is the time to remember the old, trusty, much criticized psychoanalysis. And free associations. We need to find the alternative connections between the events in the accessible parts of the timeline and the events in the lost parts. This way we reconnect and reinforce the graph of memories.</p><p>In most cases we can use logic and find the evidence of what was going on during the blackout. These events can be good starting points in our investigations.</p><p>I tried to do this analysis/reconnection a few times, and it worked. Seemingly lost memories were coming back. The timings were mixed up, but most logical connections between the events were there. The results are not perfect, but this is something. And something is better than nothing.</p><p>We will definitely need proper research here. More patients. Standardized conditions. Focus on different types of associations. These thoughts and interpretations are a little bit premature at this point. We have to understand that. But maybe they'll help somebody find something new.</p><p>P.S.: Failed defragmentation of the memory graph can lead to several kinds of long-term impairments. Not every one of them is technically reversible. The most dangerous problem is the accidental creation of new connections between things. Some would probably use the term "delusions" for them. Memory may look intact and be completely messed up at the same time. When working with memory, we should always validate data. Always. If something doesn't fit, we have to use logic and external evidence to fix it.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/a-dream-within-a-dream">A dream within a dream</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;23</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-79408" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-79408)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ea5c652e6bfe56e5d1d3df55b2de8942.jpg" alt="A dream within a dream" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>How do you know that you're not dreaming? Philosophers have asked this question for centuries. Everything got mixed up. Dreams. Illusions. Hallucinations. Simulated realities. Everything in one basket.</p><p>Technically, memory hallucinations, including dreams and effects like deja vu or jamais vu, are the results of data readouts during a hot memory maintenance. Defragmentation is the key process there. We expect to see a loss of continuity. Things will suddenly disappear or appear out of nowhere. Pay attention. Make notes. Compare notes. If something is off, you'll notice that.</p><p>Also, physics will be broken. Hallucinating brains will not be able to build the reflection that matches any random object. It's just a reading process that happens in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not a computation. Combinations of pieces of data can be complex and convincing, yes, but the objects have to be saved in advance. Usually we don't see things upside down, and they're not saved in our memory like that. Therefore, horizontal reflections of them cannot be hallucinated. Actually, it's a funny problem with AI image generators. Most of them have real troubles with rendering arbitrary objects upside down. For this exact reason. Oh, and vampires and other unholy otherworldly creatures don't reflect in rivers. It's the same thing.</p><p>However, you have to remember that you need to test things. If you don't remember that, you will get the "butterfly dream", that leads to all sorts of speculations about alternative realities. Once you do the tests and see the issues, it will become clear that your memory is hallucinating.</p><p>Being inside a simulated reality is different. It's like being inside a virtual machine. Everything will look normal, consistent. When the machine is under maintenance, everything stops. Looking from the inside, you'll not notice that. You'll be stopped yourself. The time will not exist for you.</p><p>Usually, when we create malware, we want it to know that it's not inside some virtual machine under investigation. How? We collect information about the system. We know what to expect in the real machine, and we look for something out of place. Virtual machines don't simulate every aspect of real ones. It requires a lot of resources and is unnecessary for standard applications. They may simulate hardware that was never produced by any manufacturer. Sometimes we expect to see some user activity and it's not there. We can use all these things as clues.</p><p>The problem with the offline world is that we don't know what is supposed to be here. Without that knowledge, all these comparisons are useless.</p><p>What if the machine itself is glitching? It's a good question. 99% of our code is utter garbage. Why would we even think that the programmers of the matrix are better in that department? We can look for bugs. Great. How do we know that something is a bug and not a feature? We compare the system's behavior with its specification. Where is our specification for the universe? Oh, wait. We got a problem.</p><p>Even if we imagine a program that somehow understands that it is running inside a virtual machine, even if it finds a way to break out, it's still a program, just running on real hardware. There is no way out of here.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/memory">memory</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-abyss">The abyss</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;17</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-56512" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-56512)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/b34b6df311471d9400e88ca902077118.jpg" alt="The abyss" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Usually, when psychologists talk about the internet and social networks, they ask questions about the changes in our lives. How do all these technologies affect our relationships? How do they affect our IQ? Mental health? Whatever. There are many questions to ask, lots of things to worry about. But there is another side of this coin that seems to be underrepresented in discussions:</p><p>How do social networks change the science itself?</p><p>Psychologists are whining about a crisis in the field for decades now. No good theories. No good models. Old ones fall apart. We'll never understand the mind. It's way too complex. But. What do you need to make a good model of something? You need data. Good quality data. With all sorts of edge cases, rare cases, exceptions, etc. You need to know what can happen. Even if it happens once in a billion. You don't need statistics. You need proof of existence.</p><p>A century ago people were spending their whole lives looking for those rare cases. It's hard work. Most old theories were based on very limited datasets. They just don't cover the whole variety of possible behaviors. But these days, with all our technologies, we can collect everything we need to build good models. We just need our computers and a stable internet connection. People all around the world have smartphones with cameras. They film everything for us. Especially if something looks unusual, we can be sure that somebody will film it and post it online to get likes and subscribers.</p><p>Do you know that a dog and a goose can be friends? Monkeys use plants as medicine? Ants farm other insects? There are videos out there, waiting to be studied.</p><p>And people... Oh. They do all sorts of things as well. Beautiful. Odd. Terrifying. You can see everything now. If you're not afraid to gaze into the abyss, of course.</p><p>We have videos of all sorts of behaviors of humans and animals in their natural habitats. Pure. Raw. No rules. No limits. We have uncensored materials with the people from the darkest criminal corners of society. We have bloggers in the war zones. We have diaries of patients with various psychiatric diseases, who share their first-hand experiences. We have interviews with chiefs of the remote tribes who still live in the Stone Age. All sorts of cultures, religions, professions. Everything. All this data just waits for us there. Social networks became the literal heaven for psychologists.</p><p>It's time to stop whining.

If you're out of context here, please <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">read about this project</a> first, particularly about the theoretically possible diseases.</p><p>For most practical applications, it will be convenient to split the pairs of mirrored patterns of behavior into four clusters: "traumatized" (1+9) and (7+15), "paranoid" (2+10) and (8+16), "creative" (3+11) and (6+14), "destructive" (4+12) and (5+13).</p><p>It is important to notice that these four clusters are not the types of schizophrenia. There is only one disease. The broken switch. One. This division is just a way to highlight the most distinct versions of observable behavior. To see the extremes. It helps to work with the patterns. Nothing more.</p><p>The reason I decided to talk about these clusters now, and to not wait for the second part of the project to be finished, is because the creative cluster starts to look like a safe place to be. According to the data I have now, the patterns here don't include anything that can theoretically lead to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. They're concentrated around the traumatized and paranoid clusters. And you don't want to go down that road, trust me. Also, there is no basis for the dangerous antisocial behavior in the creative cluster.</p><p>Some researchers suggest that art therapy helps to deal with the symptoms of schizophrenia. Further investigations are required, but so far it looks like that kind of therapy pushes the patients exactly into this cluster of patterns. They just do it intuitively, without the system we have.</p><p>In some circumstances this creative behavior can be classified not even as schizophrenia, but as the schizotypal personality disorder, or some other "not as serious" disease, to reduce the stigma around the patients. This messes up the data in the field. It may look like there are several diseases here. But no. It's the same core problem. Just the different pairs of patterns.</p><p>We can try to build the roadmaps for cognitive behavioral therapy around this information. By pushing the patients to the creative cluster, we can help them avoid some troubles that disease prepared for them in other clusters. And then we can use the standard technique, blocking half of the table, that I described in the main theory, to get some energy back. This two-step therapy is not a cure. It can't be. But it looks like a promising direction to look at, if we want to help the patients feel better.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/and-how-does-that-make-you-feel">And how does that make you feel?</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;15</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-66409" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-66409)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/af3023a3ea2106e2a3bca984cffce4c8.jpg" alt="And how does that make you feel?" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The central part of my theory of behavior, the mechanism that connects the basic impulses, is a finite-state machine.</p><p>We can add some time modifiers for the basic impulses. Long ago. Last time. Real time. Expected in the future. Something like that. We can add the diagnostic flags for the current or recently finished processes. Are they ok, or are there any problems? Also, we can add some system notifications for wounds, gaining or losing resources, memory malfunctions, etc.</p><p>This will lead us to the machine with a few hundred possible states. It's not that much, actually, in the IT world we deal with much more complex machines. But in a biological context, it's not just data. Every state may have a corresponding feeling to it. Emotion, as some might say.</p><p>The emotions that come from the diagnostic data are universal. They do not depend on the patterns of behavior. Both predators and prey can have them. And they change all the time, following the events.</p><p>However, some emotions are exclusive to different patterns. Prey will never feel the pleasant anticipation of supremacy when you're preparing to taste the fresh blood of your opponent. It's a purely predatory thing to feel.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don't have the names for all the states of this machine. For all emotions. This makes the research difficult. It's exactly the situation where the language determines thought. Without the words, it may feel like there is nothing to explore there. There is something.</p><p>If we assume that these feelings are a signalling system that helps to coordinate the activities inside the individual, or to coordinate the actions with the neighbours, then the question arises: how do you control them? Is it even possible? Or maybe this control is just some useless wordplay, because technically the emotion is just the description of the state of the machine?</p><p>In the field of psychology, the control of emotions is a popular thing to discuss. However, I always felt like there was something off about it. The only way to really change emotions is by changing behavior. If your behavior is the same, you'll get back to the same combinations of emotions over and over, no matter how hard you're trying to control them.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/emotions">emotions</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/problem-of-evil">Problem of evil</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;14</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-491531" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-491531)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/6b2aa3c6d84547b673c0a30049cbeffd.jpg" alt="Problem of evil" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>The connections between the basic impulses and <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">patterns of behavior in my theory</a> are based on pure logic. One of the interesting moments in this system is that the process of creation happens to be present only on the proactive predatory side of the table. You don't just have to be intelligent to create completely new things, you have to be a predator. Not a prey.</p><p>If we assume that our logic holds in the world outside of our universe, the connections between the actions will be the same out there. It means that the theoretical creator of our universe has to behave like a predator as well. And this fact does not depend on any particular flavor of religion.</p><p>Some would say that humans are made in the image of God, although technically it's more like we are all bound by the same logic. It forces the same patterns everywhere. We can all be violent. We can destroy others for our own benefit. It's in our blood. Maybe we don't look as scary as our chimp cousins, but the behavior is practically the same.</p><p>This leads us to the so-called problem of evil. Some people see God as some omnipotent all-loving entity, and this contradicts the observable bad things that happen on Earth. But. All sorts of temptations and destructions come along with creation in the patterns. It's natural. It's not like that person is pure evil, no. It's more like, as criminal profilers say, "capable of".</p><p>Interestingly enough, gods in pagan worlds are seriously biased towards destruction. Looking across Europe, from Ancient Greece to Slavic mythology, we see gods of war, soldiers, hunters, reapers, rulers of the underworld, provokers of natural disasters... Just a few of them seem to be friendly. More or less. If you don't play with them. Most lore around these guys is quite grim. I don't really understand how people got from that to the one and only all-loving hippie God. Human mind definitely works in mysterious ways.</p><p>* This text doesn't have any intentions to offend the believers. Just some direction for theologians to explore.

He can either follow the rules of the group, or rebel against them. The judgement comes from the chosen path.</p><p>Different groups will have different rules. We expect that. It will not be a big problem, as long as you stay with just one group. But there is a much deeper question here.</p><p>Let's say we have a group with some rules and an individual on his own. In order to join, to follow the new moral rules of the group, he needs to have free will. He has to rewire his existing instructions for behavior. To rebel against his past. This is what the group members will expect him to do. To leave the past behind and become one of their own. To become a good person. But once he's there, they will want him to stop. He has to follow their rules and do not change his path ever again. Apparently, it's morally wrong to rebel the second time. He will become a traitor. A sinner.</p><p>This creates a brainwashing paradox of moral responsibility. You need to have free will to join the group of moralists, but you need to lose free will to stay in it. Otherwise you will be constantly bullied by other members of the group for thinking alternative thoughts, asking unwanted questions, and considering actions against their moral rules in general.</p><p>Not every group has this sort of moral pressure, of course. Some groups are open to changes. They are ready to let their members go. However, some groups are almost obsessed with their rules and stability.</p><p>In my theory, I proposed that this loss of free will, loss of the ability to change, is not a good thing. It's a sickness. It's a psychiatric disease that we haven't discovered yet. And these are not just thoughts out of nowhere. I saw some groups of people who do not just judge others all day long, but they repeat each other a lot. They repeat long sentences word by word. They repeat everyday actions. They literally cannot sustain a conversation about anything new. They seem to lose the ability to learn things. The longer you look, the more you see. At some moment it starts to feel like they're not human. It's kind of a creepy thing to observe, actually.</p><p>My point here is that the relations between moral responsibility and free will seem to be complicated. I even start to think that we don't treat the lack of free will as a separate disease just because a lot of societies in our world want to see their members not have it. They're being constantly told that it is morally good to follow the flow and be happy.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/scattered-morality">Scattered morality</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;10</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-343217" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-343217)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/da3e17d4daa664da7f3753d9aa637079.jpg" alt="Scattered morality" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Values. Virtues. Priorities. Morality. Where do all these things come from? Looking from the perspective of the <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a>, we expect to see two kinds of values: personal and collective.</p><p>Personal values come from the patterns of behavior. If something supports the pattern, it is good. If something stops the pattern, it is bad.</p><p>We expect to see a unique set of personal values for every pattern of the class I. Some of them can be combined within the patterns of the class II. Some of them contradict each other in diseases. These personal values change when the individual switches to another pattern of behavior.</p><p>This kind of evaluation, what's good or bad, does not require any intelligence to be used. It comes from the alignment of the upcoming events with the patterns. No rules to create here. Little kids and animals seem to use this kind of values. They don't need to be taught what's important. They already know. This is the most primal kind of judgement. The inevitable one.</p><p>Collective morality is different. It is a set of created rules. We need intelligence to create and follow the rules. Those little kids and most animals will have problems with them.</p><p>Created rules are not connected to the fixed patterns of behavior anymore. We expect to see the variety of them being invented, changed, and discarded through history. Naturally, different social groups will have different sets of created and shared rules.</p><p>There is no such thing as universal objective morality. Personal values from one pattern will inevitably contradict the values from some other patterns. Created rules will follow the interests of different individuals and groups, and will contradict the rules created by their neighbours.</p><p>There are ways to balance the collective interests to some degree. However, the personal pattern-based values are fixed. The only way to change them is by switching patterns. But we cannot make all men use just one pattern for a long period of time. We need different patterns to sustain and develop civilization. This is the curse that humanity has to deal with. And all those theoretical alien civilizations will have the same problem as well. Actually, this can be a sad solution to the Fermi paradox. We are all doomed to never work together efficiently. And to colonize the universe we have to do that.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/is-there-any-other-way">Is there any other way?</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;06</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-768371" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-768371)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/73bb3d0913b06d6694a208a25416d270.jpg" alt="Is there any other way?" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Evolution is all about the increasing complexity of the systems. How do we increase complexity? We combine things. And mutate them. Combine. Mutate. Combine. Mutate. Combine. Mutate. Etc.</p><p>There is a confusing saying, "evolution by natural selection". It sounds almost like "complexity increases because of destruction". It does not. It increases because of combinations and mutations. Destruction can create the alternative paths to follow within the tree of combinations, but it does not create the combinations themselves.</p><p>If we imagine the world without destruction, the architect's playground, and we wait for eons, we will see all the possible systems being created. But. Not everything can be created within the universe. There are limits. There are rules. There is a natural order. We cannot deny physics.</p><p>This means not only that some things cannot be technically constructed, but also that some existing systems can have only one possible architecture. When we study a complex system that we don't understand, we can ask an important question: how to design this thing, and is there any other way to do that?</p><p>We can dive into a black-box penetration testing of sorts. We collect data from inputs and outputs of the system, we learn about the limitations, we make educated guesses on how it is being constructed inside, and then we crack it. This approach can be applied to the psyche of the living organisms, not only to the IT systems. Although I expect that some psychologists would say that this idea is borderline insane.</p><p>Let's say we observe some behavior. What parts and processes are the necessary ingredients to build it? Are there many ways to build it? Or maybe not? Some things cannot happen simultaneously. Some things require other things. Some things have inevitable consequences. We may have different brain chemistry, different environments, different ways to convert energy, but these are ripples on the water. The options in the very core of the psyche are limited.</p><p>I believe that understanding the inevitable parts of the tree of combinations, the universal modules and processes in the psyche, that do not depend on anything except basic physics and logic, is the way to resolve the current theory crisis in psychology.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/architect-mindset">The architect's mindset</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;06&nbsp;/&nbsp;28</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="682" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-493457" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-493457)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e417661de1e956270ec6980fbb2b85d8.jpg" alt="The architects mindset" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Let's imagine we're architects. We have a task to design a machine, a replicant, that will mimic human behavior. Or some animal. Let's say we have a "free will" module. We can plug it into the replicant. But. What is the functional role of this module?</p><p>The average answer to this question in my environment is that this module gives the replicant the ability to rebel. To give a finger. To go outside the path that was prepared for him. Burn the bridges. Do things in his own way. If you provide him a 50/50 choice to press a left or right button, he will give you a finger and he will not press any of them. Without this module, he will be a robotic slave, repeating the same instructions over and over. Following the master's orders. With it, the replicant will always have the alternative options to consider in his decision-making unit.</p><p>To perform its role, the module has to be connected to the memory mechanism. It is supposed to extend or override the saved instructions, how to behave, with something outside of that memory.</p><p>First, this means that the "free will" module can work only with the systems of specific complexity. You need a memory mechanism to be present and filled with instructions. At least a read-only memory. Atoms don't have it. Stars don't have it. Human has. Dog has. Replicant will have.</p><p>Second, the "free will" module, by its design, leads to the alternative contradictory processes inside the replicant. They will be destructive either to his memory, or some other parts, including the complete self-destruction, or to his environment. The additional self-preservation module will help to balance things out in the long run. Also, this "free will" module is not the one that will make the replicant follow the same rules for a long period of time. Including the moral rules. We will have to add another module for that.</p><p>From the perspective of the architects, it doesn't really matter how exactly this module will work inside, as long as it fulfills its functional role. We can put the true randomness inside. It can be some determined but unpredictable system. It can be an antenna that receives a stream of data from the other side of the universe. Engineers will provide us options. As long as this mechanism is not being controlled directly from the memory of the replicant, it will work. It will make the replicant rebel.</p><p>The point of this passage is not to talk about the free will specifically, but to point a finger at the mindset that seems to be lacking in the western field of philosophy. Think like an architect. Think about systems. Modules. Functional roles. Connections. Use cases. Generalized patterns. This is the way to see the big picture, even if you don't possess the final engineering details. This mindset helps to bring different concepts together and to guide the further research, instead of producing all these endless debates that don't lead to any new information whatsoever.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/freedom">Freedom</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;06&nbsp;/&nbsp;01</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-565056" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-565056)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/bd85f0d1818cc1ef812041c3c70070fd.jpg" alt="Freedom" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Free will. I use it in my work. Never questioned it. But it seems like in the western philosophy people talk a lot about determinism. They have arguments against freedom. So I asked myself, why our ideas look so different?</p><p>During my childhood, I got two perspectives, two ways of seeing the freedom. One from the Eastern Orthodox Church, and another one from the local pagans and occultists.</p><p>Pagans believe in chaos. We come from it. We return to it. It is home. It is freedom. The absolute freedom. And even when we stuck in the limited material body, we still carry a piece of chaos inside. This is our nature. This is who we are. By embracing the chaos, we get the freedom to do anything. To change the world. I like this position. There is something in it.</p><p>Christians believe in the same chaos, but they associate it with sins. They agree that we all have it inside, but they say it's dangerous. It's like a spiritual sickness. It makes you do stupid things. You'll get hurt by following it. This is not the kind of freedom, that would be wise to have. They talk about the self-preservation a lot, actually. They give you a list of things that you're supposed to do to survive and protect your kin. They may call it a God's will. The right way to be. Whatever. They appreciate, when you exercise your will, and work hard according to these rules.</p><p>Both parties agree, that we do include some chaos inside us, some freedom to do things, but they have different opinions on what we should do with it. Some say we should embrace the chaos and do things just because we can, and some say we should work to control it, and preserve ourselves. This duality stuck very deep in my head, and, apparently, it got reflected in my work.</p><p>In the English-speaking world, at least in the debates on YouTube and Reddit, people are greatly influenced by Protestantism. They talk a lot about the faith, grace, and divine things, that generally happen on their own. They don't really talk about the chaos, and they don't talk about your personal actions that make the difference. You just need to have faith and the universe will take care of everything else. Psychological determinism fits quite naturally in this cultural environment. Things had been set for you already. You will not change anything. Freedom is an illusion.</p><p>I won't make any conclusions here. We don't have enough data to completely prove determinism, or to prove it wrong. These are just some thoughts on the cultural differences that may affect the behavior and our philosophical views.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/religion">religion</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/alchemy">Alchemy</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;06&nbsp;/&nbsp;01</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-591156" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-591156)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/d59fec68d699de9ffba75c39172f4543.jpg" alt="Alchemy" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Right now I'm working on the second part of my crazy project. I use the <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a> as a guide to reinterpret and reconnect the available data from the worlds of neuroscience and psychiatry.</p><p>Everything looks promising so far. Various facts are being attached to the central model of the theory without any conflicts. But it's a long run. The model still can be wrong. And I worry, that even if everything works as expected, we will hit the wall at some moment. The available data is not unending. It's too soon to say anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, I got a question in my head. Is this science? The project itself. Or it's more like an alchemy of sorts. Playing dice with the devil, looking for the ancient wisdom lying in the plain sight, with a goal to find the cure to all diseases?</p><p>On the one hand, I make observations, use the information from the scientific journals, make hypothesis, test them, set up experiments, use all sorts of data analysis techniques, and get other professionals to review things. At the current second stage the project looks more and more like a "proper science".</p><p>On the other hand, it's like a house of cards. The basement of it, the theory of behavior itself, is essentially derived from the highly subjective observations from the mental patients and priests from various religions. Of course, it's not only that, but still. A lot of things in the very core of it cannot be properly measured at this moment. We need them to construct the mechanical model that connects the patterns of behavior and diseases, and it kind of works, but we have to assume some things without any solid proof. This makes the whole thing not 100% scientific. Or, better to say, 0% scientific. It's quite an interesting situation.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/methodology">methodology</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/practical-observations">Practical observations</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;05&nbsp;/&nbsp;26</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-181536" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-181536)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/e9442e1b2a14dd8a7b950f3444dc7870.jpg" alt="Practical observations" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>I put an accent on this in the book, but it seems to be important to clarify a couple of moments, related to the practical observations. Just to make sure that we don't have any room for misinterpretations.</p><p>The <a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a> is about actions. Thoughts, emotions, and the words that are being used to express them, mean nothing, until they become the real observable actions. Individuals that use the reactive patterns of behavior often overestimate their proactive abilities in conversations and vice versa. We need to pay the attention to the actions only.</p><p>Also, results do not define approaches. If we give a relatively complex task with some degree of freedom, like having a lunch for example, to several individuals, then we will see the different approaches.</p><p>Somebody gets ten burgers, two bottles of soda on top, and then lies on a sofa, too tired to do anything else. Somebody gets an egg, espresso, and calls it a day. Somebody creates all sorts of rules. I sit here. You sit there. Knife on the right side. Fork on the left. Some speech is required. Somebody gets a pig's head, puts an apple in its mouth, adds leaves and flowers, creating a piece of art and telling a story in the process. At the end, some food will be eaten in all scenarios. The results will be practically the same, but the approaches are completely different and correspond to the different patterns of behavior.</p><p>In this context, it should be obvious that the profession does not define the behavior. Although some patterns would be more practical in some circumstances.</p><p>In many psychological schools, things are constructed in reverse. The emotions come first, and the actions are just the final results. But in our system actions are everything.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-magical-number-6">The magical number 6</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;05&nbsp;/&nbsp;04</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-275021" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-275021)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/9f2855bce61c2f2d756cdb74976e4536.jpg" alt="The magical number 6" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>What is the capacity of our working memory? Some classical researches suggest it's a magical number 7 for a human. Plus-minus. Some other say it's 4. Plus-minus. And something like 2 for a chimpanzee. Plus-minus. In any case, it seems that the test subjects count things and that is being used as the evidence. The rules of counting affect the results and our interpretations of them.</p><p>But how many things do we really need to hold in working memory in order to learn new things? Not just count some objects, not just mirror the actions (monkey see, monkey do), but to understand what's going on?</p><p>In order to learn, the biological processor should be able to work with transitivity and Euclidean relations. So, how many memory cells do we need to put in its cache to make everything work?</p><p>Let's start with transitivity. We need three memory cells to work with one connection from A to B. We need to save A, to save B, and to save the connection. We need five memory cells to work with two connections. A to B. B to C. We need to save A, B, C, and two connections. Five memory cells in total. If we want to use this data to create a new connection from A to C, to learn something, we need the sixth memory cell. We need to save that new connection somewhere. The same logic works with the Euclidean relations as well. The same 6 memory cells are required.</p><p>This means that the evolution from 5 to 6 memory cells is the step from the intellectually disabled monkey to the organism that can learn things. It's quite an important step. I'm surprised that the cognitive psychologists don't talk about this elephant in the room.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/math">math</a></li><li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/intelligence">intelligence</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">The evolutionary theory of behavior</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;03&nbsp;/&nbsp;14</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="1080" width="1920"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-678891" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-678891)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/df8775320defaf79dcd42066dc4f04df.jpg" alt="The evolutionary theory of behavior" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>In the fields of psychiatry, psychology, we have a lot of problems right now. The causes of the diseases are not really determined. The symptoms are vague and hard to differentiate. The treatments often look like an alchemy. Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Who knows. Maybe another will work. Or not. The psychological theories allow some very loose interpretations, where the chemical processes behind the processes in the psyche should be very precise. In the world of neurochemistry, we have a lot of scattered pieces of information, but they do not explain how all these things work together.</p><p>We definitely need some fresh eyes. So I started the project, that is supposed to bring the new approaches, the new ways to interpret the collected information in the world of psychaitry. I use the ideas from the completely different fields, from the ancient philosophy to the modern computer science and engineering, to shake things a bit.</p><p>The first part of the project was published as the <a href="/evolutionary-theory-of-behavior">evolutionary theory of behavior</a>. This is a theory that connects the parts of the psyche, the basic impulses, the observable patterns of behavior, the diseases and the effects in the social groups, attaching everything to the one purely mechanical model.</p><p>The second part of the project is the search for this model, or the similar one, in the field of neurochemistry. Instead of trying to explain every little fact on its own, I look for the similar graph of connections between things. My main hypothesis is that if we can connect things from the outside, the similar graph of connections should be somewhere on the inside. If we find it, it will show us the exact places where the diseases begin. This is a long shot. I know. But it is worth trying.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/publications">publications</a></li><li><a href="/tag/books">books</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article></main> <nav> <h2>Search for:</h2> <br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/emotions/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">emotions&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/evolution/" style="font-size: 122.41379310344827%">&starf;&nbsp;evolution&nbsp;(41)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/free_will/" style="font-size: 87.24137931034483%">free_will&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/intelligence/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">intelligence&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/language/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">language&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/memory/" style="font-size: 90.34482758620689%">memory&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/methodology/" style="font-size: 89.3103448275862%">methodology&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/morality/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">morality&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/philosophy/" style="font-size: 97.58620689655172%">philosophy&nbsp;(17)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/psychology/" style="font-size: 95.51724137931035%">psychology&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/religion/" style="font-size: 83.10344827586206%">religion&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/schizophrenia/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">schizophrenia&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> <br><br>+<br><br> <ul> <li> <a href="/tag/animation/" style="font-size: 140%">animation&nbsp;(58)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/books/" style="font-size: 88.27586206896552%">books&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/canvas/" style="font-size: 110%">canvas&nbsp;(29)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/codepen/" style="font-size: 155.51724137931035%">codepen&nbsp;(73)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/css/" style="font-size: 119.3103448275862%">css&nbsp;(38)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/github/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">github&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/habrahabr/" style="font-size: 108.96551724137932%">habrahabr&nbsp;(28)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/html/" style="font-size: 111.0344827586207%">html&nbsp;(30)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/javascript/" style="font-size: 141.0344827586207%">javascript&nbsp;(59)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/linux/" style="font-size: 81.03448275862068%">linux&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/math/" style="font-size: 99.65517241379311%">math&nbsp;(19)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/music/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">music&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/photography/" style="font-size: 84.13793103448276%">photography&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/podcast/" style="font-size: 82.06896551724138%">podcast&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/publications/" style="font-size: 113.10344827586206%">publications&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/svg/" style="font-size: 103.79310344827587%">svg&nbsp;(23)&nbsp;</a> </li><li> <a href="/tag/webgl/" style="font-size: 100.6896551724138%">webgl&nbsp;(20)&nbsp;</a> </li> </ul> </nav> <footer>Copyright &copy; Ivan Bogachev 2016-2025</footer> <script>const images=document.querySelectorAll("img");images.forEach(e=>{e.complete?e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0):e.addEventListener("load",()=>{e.setAttribute("data-lazy-loaded",!0)})})</script> <script src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script> </body> </html>
