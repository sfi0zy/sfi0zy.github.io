href="/post/scattered-morality">conflicting values</a>, but in all cases we create rules to preserve what's important for us. Also, we need resources. We have to protect our society from direct destruction, but keep it refueled at the same time.</p><p>For every danger, we're trying to find a counterbalance that would be strong enough to stop it, but not too strong. We need to keep access to our resources. It's a tricky balance.</p><p>If you build a village in the middle of a desert to protect it from fire, your folks will have problems with hunting and foraging. If you put everybody in prison for minor violations, you'll have no workers to run your factories. If you reject all scary technologies, you'll likely have to spend more time doing your job in an old-fashioned way.</p><p>In management, we have to choose between weak control with more resources and strict control with fewer resources. In many cases you'll have a tempting choice to do things against the rules, off the record, to get something inaccessible.</p><p>Determinists often reference the experiment with judges. If they eat well, they are more likely to vote for minor punishments, and vice versa. More resources come together with less control.</p><p>But all these rules for preservation and trials have nothing to do with human agency, or whatever you'll call it. We easily create rules for other species, for machines, for everything we have. When we evaluate the danger that comes from some subject, we think about our preservation, but not metaphysics.</p><p>What we can do, if a subject has intelligence, is to check the rules in his memory. If he has the rules to violate our rules, we get rid of him. If he doesn't have any rules to violate our rules, we may have a discussion. We can use his resources for our own benefit. Or not. We may have a rule to not negotiate.</p><p>You don't need an absolute god-like free will that violates all laws of physics to work with rules and order. Even in the world of machines, they may have tasks for self-preservation and resources to manage. There is nothing supernatural here.</p><p>However, free will in a more grounded sense, like the mechanism that mutates data in memory, is important. A subject that possesses the ability to change his own behavior has a great risk of becoming a rebel and destroying our system from the inside. And it doesn't matter if he uses his own agency or has some predetermined instructions to bring the cosmic chaos on our heads. He has enough freedom to cause problems anyway.</p><p>Will you vote to lock him away in advance to protect the order?</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/relative-irrationality">Relative irrationality</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;08&nbsp;/&nbsp;22</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-465815" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-465815)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/49eb322fd06dd97d5a9eb8c8f9a81d3f.jpg" alt="Relative irrationality" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Irrational. I avoided this word for a while. It's way too confusing. With a dream to build a replicant that will mimic human behavior, I'm looking for engineering explanations for everything, but irrational thinking is something odd. What is it? How do you build it? Nobody has any blueprints of it. I started to scroll through examples of irrational thoughts and actions with a hope to find some patterns in this mess on my own...</p><p>Constant fear of safety. Perceiving every environment as dangerous. Choices to not do anything. Procrastination. Consuming instead of creating. Ignoring. Crying for help when not needed... Wait. No. This looks like the processes on the reactive side of the table. These are patterns of behavior of the prey animals. They don't make any sense for a predator.</p><p>Eventually I got some reversed examples, where the predatory behavior was claimed to be irrational from the perspective of the prey. That's an interesting duality of opinions. Almost like we have two opposing kinds of reasoning, and everybody believes that his reasoning is the rational one.</p><p>It looks like this whole thing is not about you choosing emotions over brains, but about somebody wanting you to be a predator, while you're not one of them, or vice versa.</p><p>This means that the term "irrational" is relative, actually. You're always rational in relation to your own patterns of behavior, but at the same time you can be irrational in relation to the patterns on the other side. In many ways it's like a <a href="/post/scattered-morality">personal morality</a>. It's not universal by definition.</p><p>In mania, depression, catatonia, and schizophrenia, we see combinations of contradicting patterns inside one individual. The behavior goes against itself. These are real conflicts in logic. Most people who are blamed to be irrational do not have anything like that. They're not sick in any way. They just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are being confronted with some expectations.</p><p>Sometimes healthy people may want to switch to other kinds of behavior for some reason. We can help them, but we have to keep in mind that this is not about some minor thoughts. The chemistry of the whole organism will be affected. New behavior will seriously contradict the existing one.</p><p>We expect to see the withdrawal symptoms during the switch. The relationships in the groups will be destroyed. You cannot change a side for real and pretend that nothing happened. It's not just dreams. There will be consequences. You have to burn your old life to build a new one. Not every person out there will be ready to pay the price. It will look like an irrational thing to do.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/psychology">psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/free-will-and-moral-responsibility">Free will and moral responsibility</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;12</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-650068" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-650068)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/ebf2df10390026a78411760257509774.jpg" alt="Free will and moral responsibility" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>When we talk about moral responsibility, we usually mean that somebody has two options. He can either follow the rules of the group, or rebel against them. The judgement comes from the chosen path.</p><p>Different groups will have different rules. We expect that. It will not be a big problem, as long as you stay with just one group. But there is a much deeper question here.</p><p>Let's say we have a group with some rules and an individual on his own. In order to join, to follow the new moral rules of the group, he needs to have free will. He has to rewire his existing instructions for behavior. To rebel against his past. This is what the group members will expect him to do. To leave the past behind and become one of their own. To become a good person. But once he's there, they will want him to stop. He has to follow their rules and do not change his path ever again. Apparently, it's morally wrong to rebel the second time. He will become a traitor. A sinner.</p><p>This creates a brainwashing paradox of moral responsibility. You need to have free will to join the group of moralists, but you need to lose free will to stay in it. Otherwise you will be constantly bullied by other members of the group for thinking alternative thoughts, asking unwanted questions, and considering actions against their moral rules in general.</p><p>Not every group has this sort of moral pressure, of course. Some groups are open to changes. They are ready to let their members go. However, some groups are almost obsessed with their rules and stability.</p><p>In my theory, I proposed that this loss of free will, loss of the ability to change, is not a good thing. It's a sickness. It's a psychiatric disease that we haven't discovered yet. And these are not just thoughts out of nowhere. I saw some groups of people who do not just judge others all day long, but they repeat each other a lot. They repeat long sentences word by word. They repeat everyday actions. They literally cannot sustain a conversation about anything new. They seem to lose the ability to learn things. The longer you look, the more you see. At some moment it starts to feel like they're not human. It's kind of a creepy thing to observe, actually.</p><p>My point here is that the relations between moral responsibility and free will seem to be complicated. I even start to think that we don't treat the lack of free will as a separate disease just because a lot of societies in our world want to see their members not have it. They're being constantly told that it is morally good to follow the flow and be happy.</p></div> </div> <footer> <span>Tags:</span> <ul> <li><a href="/tag/evolution">evolution</a></li><li><a href="/tag/philosophy">philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tag/free_will">free_will</a></li><li><a href="/tag/morality">morality</a></li> </ul> </footer> </article> <article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Blog"> <header> <h2 itemprop="headline"><a href="/post/scattered-morality">Scattered morality</a></h2> <div> <small>2025&nbsp;/&nbsp;07&nbsp;/&nbsp;10</small> </div> </header> <div> <div class="lazy-image"> <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" height="683" width="1024"> <defs> <linearGradient id="svg-id-851727" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%" gradientTransform="rotate(45)"> <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#eeeeee;stop-opacity:1"/> <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"/> </linearGradient> </defs> <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="url(#svg-id-851727)"/> </svg> <img src="/images/da3e17d4daa664da7f3753d9aa637079.jpg" alt="Scattered morality" itemprop="image"> </div> <div itemprop="text"><p>Values. Virtues. Priorities. Morality. Where do all these things come from? Looking from the perspective of the evolutionary theory of behavior, we expect to see two kinds of values: personal and collective.</p><p>Personal values come from the patterns of behavior. If something supports the pattern, it is good. If something stops the pattern, it is bad.</p><p>We expect to see a unique set of personal values for every pattern of the class I. Some of them can be combined within the patterns of the class II. Some of them contradict each other in diseases. These personal values change when the individual switches to another pattern of behavior.</p><p>This kind of evaluation, what's good or bad, does not require any intelligence to be used. It comes from the alignment of the upcoming events with the patterns. No rules to create here. Little kids and animals seem to use this kind of values. They don't need to be taught what's important. They already know. This is the most primal kind of judgement. The inevitable one.</p><p>Collective morality is different. It is a set of created rules. We need intelligence to create and follow the rules. Those little kids and most animals will have problems with them.</p><p>Created rules are not connected to the fixed patterns of behavior anymore. We expect to see the variety of them being invented, changed, and discarded through history. Naturally, different social groups will have different sets of created and shared rules.</p><p>There is no such thing as universal objective morality. Personal values from one pattern will inevitably contradict the values from some other patterns. Created rules will follow the interests of different individuals and groups, and will contradict the rules created by their neighbours.</p><p>There are ways to balance the collective interests to some degree. However, the personal pattern-based values are fixed. The only way to change them is by switching patterns. But we cannot make all men use just one pattern for a long period of time. We need different patterns to sustain and develop civilization. This is the curse that humanity has to deal with. And all those theoretical alien civilizations will have the same problem as well. Actually, this can be a sad solution to the Fermi paradox. We are all doomed to never work together efficiently.
