<div class='mui-post -about'>
    <p class='mui-p'>Hello! I'm Ivan Bogachev and I'm a musician and web developer.</p>
    <p class='mui-p'>I have some skills in front-end development (see my profiles on <a href='https://codepen.io/sfi0zy'>codepen.io</a> and <a href='https://toster.ru/user/sfi0zy'>toster.ru</a>). I came to the web development when HTML5 and CSS3 were already there, so I can use them. For my personal projects I use ES6 and LESS and Grunt for compiling. Previously I had some experience with jQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize.css, Skeleton.css and React.js a little. I can't say that my skills are amazing, but I can use Google very fast. Last months I started to collect good ideas and realizations of web components to the one place and now I write my own UI framework called Muilessium (it is in pre-pre-pre-alpha state, but this website is powered by it and it works as I see).</p>
