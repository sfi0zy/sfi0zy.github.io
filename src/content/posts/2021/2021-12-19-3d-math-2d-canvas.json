        "I've published a new example on CodePen today. It's a combination of 3D math with vectors, matrices, quaternions, and a simple 2D canvas. In this example, I show how to combine all these things to create a projection of the 3D world on the screen. This example is quite simple and quite hard at the same time. I haven't published anything similar before and I hope it'll help my students with their projects.",
