        "Winter is my time for major upgrades. This week I upgraded my elementary OS, installed tons of programs, re-created my settings for terminal, my vim configuration for frontend development, and saved every action in [this repository](https://github.com/sfi0zy/workspace-setup). These bash scripts will work as a setup wizard next time. Feel free to fork this repository and create your own workspace setups."
