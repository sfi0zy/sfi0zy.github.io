        "I wrote an article about [one of my VR experiments](https://habrahabr.ru/post/333400/). I created a website that can be viewed using Google Cardboard or similar devices. The experiment works in desktop browsers only due to the bad support of device orientation detection in mobile browsers for today, but it can be a starting point for future experiments.",
