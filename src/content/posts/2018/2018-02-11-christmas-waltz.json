        "The winter is ending, but I'd like to present the Christmas waltz that I wrote a couple of days ago. This is a short, festive waltz for a chamber orchestra. I composed it for the piano and it was a common etude for beginners, but later, when I tried to use some synthesized strings and a glockenspiel, it was transformed into a beautiful composition.",
