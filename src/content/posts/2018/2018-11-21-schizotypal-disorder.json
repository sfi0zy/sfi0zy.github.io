        "The [article about my illness](https://habr.com/post/430224/) became quite popular. I wasn't expecting this. In a nutshell, I wrote about my observations, apathy, emotions, illusions, and other strange phenomena.",
        "UPD 2025: This article gives hope to some people, so it'll stay online. But it reflects my outdated and naive understanding of various phenomena. It fits in the old theories that my ex-doctors used, but looks questionable in the light of my theory of behavior. I think that we should treat this publication as obsolete."
