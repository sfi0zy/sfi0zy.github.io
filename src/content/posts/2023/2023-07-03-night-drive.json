        "Ok. It's time to refresh my CodePen profile a bit. In the last years I published mostly educational examples for my students, but it feels like they can't really work as an example of my own skills. A lot of people can do the same tricks nowadays. They looked cool five years ago, but not anymore. I needed something that would look impressive enough, so I created a new demo, \"Night Drive\". It'll show what I can do with Three.js in one day.",
