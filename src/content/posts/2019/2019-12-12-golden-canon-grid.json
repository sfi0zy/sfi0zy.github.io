        "Today I would like to present my [new article about the Golden Canon grid](https://habr.com/ru/post/479580/). It's not about the golden ratio, not about the history of book printing, but about websites. The modern CSS gives us the possibility to work with such grids without pain. CSS grid layout is a very powerful tool in this case. I explained how to use it when building promotional websites."
