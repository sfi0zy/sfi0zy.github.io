        "A few days ago I played with different LESS mixins. It was boring a little, and I've added some keyframes to my demo and got this nice animation. I made a couple of stupid mistakes in the code. I know. Its performance can be improved. Ana Tudor fixed them and created an alternative version of the animation. It doesn't work in IE/Edge, but it's very interesting.",
