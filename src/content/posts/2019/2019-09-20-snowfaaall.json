        "I didn't participate in any challenges for programmers for a long time, but yesterday I decided to take part in the current weekly #codepenchallenge. It's called \"B and W and A\". What is the best thing to do with the letter \"A\"? Of course, construct snowflakes. So, I did it. This pen reminded me of those times when I created things just for fun. Anyway, this animation is nice. Check it out on CodePen!",
