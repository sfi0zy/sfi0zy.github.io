        "I answer questions on Habr Q&A, and every week I see questions about interactive maps. A lot of beginners don't understand how to create them. So I wrote a [tutorial](https://habr.com/ru/post/478698) for them. I used SVG, leader-line and hammer.js to create an interactive plan with some hover effects, arrows, and popups. I hope it'll be helpful.",
