        "I see a lot of frontend developers who are tempted to create monstrous solutions, even if they don't need to. I'm not sure if it happens because a lot of people don't know basic CSS or they think it's cool to do everything with WebGL, but it happens too often to be a coincidence. Todays demo is pretty simple, but it can show you how to split an image between multiple divs with pure CSS.",
