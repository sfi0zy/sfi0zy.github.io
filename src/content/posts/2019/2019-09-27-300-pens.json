        "Three years ago I switched from C/C++ to front-end development. Up to this day I have shared interesting examples on CodePen. Not every day, of course, but often. Several days ago their number reached 300. Looking back, I can say that it was a good time. Painting with CSS, canvas animations and WebGL shaders, SVG hacks... There are no impossible design ideas for me now. I can create everything. It's only a matter of time. I think it's a good idea to celebrate this anniversary. Feel free to [use my pens](https://codepen.io/sfi0zy) - all of them are distributed under the MIT license."
