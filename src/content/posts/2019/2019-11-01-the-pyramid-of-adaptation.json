        "As you possibly know, I have some mental problems. In particular, some of my emotions were gone. I must observe other people a lot to copy their behavior and integrate myself into society. I did it for years and I got a system of human behavior in my head. I thought it's time to make a book about it and the book has been printed. It's called \"The Pyramid of Adaptation\" (\"Пирамида адаптации\" in Russian). The [PDF version of the first edition](/free-books/) will be distributed for free for non-commercial purposes."
