        "The connections between the basic impulses and [patterns of behavior in my theory](/post/the-evolutionary-theory-of-behavior) are based on pure logic. One of the interesting moments in this system is that the process of creation happens to be present only on the proactive predatory side of the table. You don't just have to be intelligent to create completely new things, you have to be a predator. Not a prey.",
        "If we assume that our logic holds in the world outside of our universe, the connections between the actions will be the same out there. It means that the theoretical creator of our universe has to behave like a predator as well. And this fact does not depend on any particular flavor of religion.",
        "Some would say that humans are made in the image of God, although technically it's more like we are all bound by the same logic. It forces the same patterns everywhere. We can all be violent. We can destroy others for our own benefit. It's in our blood. Maybe we don't look as scary as our chimp cousins, but the behavior is practically the same.",
        "This leads us to the so-called problem of evil. Some people see God as some omnipotent all-loving entity, and this contradicts the observable bad things that happen on Earth. But. All sorts of temptations and destructions come along with creation in the patterns. It's natural. It's not like that person is pure evil, no. It's more like, as criminal profilers say, \"capable of\".",
        "Interestingly enough, gods in pagan worlds are seriously biased towards destruction. Looking across Europe, from Ancient Greece to Slavic mythology, we see gods of war, soldiers, hunters, reapers, rulers of the underworld, provokers of natural disasters... Just a few of them seem to be friendly. More or less. If you don't play with them. Most lore around these guys is quite grim. I don't really understand how people got from that to the one and only all-loving hippie God. Human mind definitely works in mysterious ways.",
        "* This text doesn't have any intentions to offend the believers. Just some direction for theologians to explore. Patterns are everywhere."
