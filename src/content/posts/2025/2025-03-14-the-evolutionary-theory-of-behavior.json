        "In the fields of psychiatry, psychology, we have a lot of problems right now. The causes of the diseases are not really determined. The symptoms are vague and hard to differentiate. The treatments often look like an alchemy. Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Who knows. Maybe another will work. Or not. The psychological theories allow some very loose interpretations, where the chemical processes behind the processes in the psyche should be very precise. In the world of neurochemistry, we have a lot of scattered pieces of information, but they do not explain how all these things work together.",
        "We definitely need some fresh eyes. So I started the project, that is supposed to bring the new approaches, the new ways to interpret the collected information in the world of psychaitry. I use the ideas from the completely different fields, from the ancient philosophy to the modern computer science and engineering, to shake things a bit.",
        "The first part of the project was published as the [evolutionary theory of behavior](/evolutionary-theory-of-behavior). This is a theory that connects the parts of the psyche, the basic impulses, the observable patterns of behavior, the diseases and the effects in the social groups, attaching everything to the one purely mechanical model.",
        "The second part of the project is the search for this model, or the similar one, in the field of neurochemistry. Instead of trying to explain every little fact on its own, I look for the similar graph of connections between things. My main hypothesis is that if we can connect things from the outside, the similar graph of connections should be somewhere on the inside. If we find it, it will show us the exact places where the diseases begin. This is a long shot. I know. But it is worth trying."
