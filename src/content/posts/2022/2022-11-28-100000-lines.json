        "Just published a new animated gallery on CodePen. As always, the ingredients are quite simple: two canvases, an old trusty line-drawing algorithm and some junior-level image data calculations. But the result looks interesting:",
        ["codepen", "QWxBNVr"],
        "It's not for mobile devices, obviously. This amount of draw calls is kind of too much for them. It works fine on my smartphone, but I think it'll be a bad practice to run such a thing for mobile devices in production.",
        "And here is another demo:",
        ["codepen", "wvXXYpP"],
        "It was the first step in the development of that gallery. It's simpler, with only one canvas, but it may work as a base for future experiments."
