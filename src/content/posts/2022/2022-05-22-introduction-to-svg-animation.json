        "I've returned. Kind of. Maybe. Just published a new article on programming - an [introduction to SVG animation](https://habr.com/ru/post/667116/). It's been a while since I wrote my last article. I compressed my experience from a few years into one lecture. It's a little more abstract than my last articles on math, more about tools, approaches, misconceptions, standards and reality of modern web development, but I believe it'll be helpful for my students. They have lots of questions about SVG and this article is supposed to cover most of them."
