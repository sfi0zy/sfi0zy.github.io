        "In the latest article I explained how to use matrices to make 3D scenes. A couple of days later I thought it would be a good idea to create an additional interactive demo for my students. And there it is. I don't know if this thing has its own name in programming or mathematics, but I call it \"techno bird\". This variation of it is written in VanillaJS and GLSL and works in all modern browsers. At least it should, I haven't tested it really. But its main purpose is to illustrate the principles from my article, so if it works in Chrome - it's enough.",
