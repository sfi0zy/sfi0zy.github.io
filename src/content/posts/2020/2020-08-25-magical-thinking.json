        "I published [an article about magical thinking](https://medium.com/@sfi0zy/%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D1%8B%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8-%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5-31641de62b64) in my blog on Medium. It contains my personal observations and thoughts from some other people with schizotypal disorder from the countries of the former USSR. The information in the article shouldnâ€™t be generalized for all patients with the same disorder or for people outside this region, but it still can be useful for psychologists."
