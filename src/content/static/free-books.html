    <h3>Pyramid of adaptation (2019)</h3>
    <p>This is a book about human behavior. The book includes the model of adaptation to society, detailed descriptions of different types of behavior, and methods of influencing people.</p>
    <p>This model had been tested, changed, and improved in various ways over years, and became the basement of the <a href='/evolutionary-theory-of-behavior/'>evolutionary theory</a>. Now the pyramid is obsolete. We have a much better model. This book will be left here for history.</p>
