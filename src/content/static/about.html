    <p>Hi. I'm Ivan. For many years I was a mathematician and creative frontend developer, working with all sorts of data visualizations, generative art, and experimental UI concepts. With time my work became less about the code, and more about the data and systems analysis.</p>

    <p>Since I have some knowledge and a personal interest in psychology and psychiatry, it felt natural to combine things. I started to analyze human behavior and create mathematical models of the psyche. It became a long-term project with the final goal to understand how we operate. From the lowest levels of the chemical processes in the brains, to the consciousness and personal wills, and to the level of societies and civilizations.</p>

    <p>A few years of analysis and experiments, triumphs and failures, gave some results. In 2025, the first important part of this project has been published as <a href='/evolutionary-theory-of-behavior'>the evolutionary theory of behavior</a>. This is the first step. A little one. It's still a lot of work to do, and I'm not even sure if we have enough tools and data to finish it in the near future, especially in the context of brain chemistry. But this is something important. I believe that this project can bring some new ideas and approaches to the field, and can help to resolve the theory crisis in psychology.</p>

    <p>Also, this work leads me to various thoughts. They provide a fresh perspective on some <a href='/tag/evolution'>philosophical and psychological subjects</a>, push ideas from one field to another, explain well-known poetic concepts using a language of engineers, and add more depth to the project itself.</p>
