I've updated the Muilessium to version 0.2. Now it uses Webpack and takes only 82KB (20KB gzipped) for scripts and 64KB (10KB gzipped) for style sheets. Since the last major update a lot of bugs were fixed and a number of new features were added.

Muilessium has Hammer.js inside itself now and uses system fonts. You can add your own custom fonts, SVG icons or iconic font. All new components and utilities are described in [official docs](http://sfi0zy.github.io/muilessium/).
