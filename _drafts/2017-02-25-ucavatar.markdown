Previously I wrote about the <a href='https://sfi0zy.github.io/codepen/unique-avatars'>generator of avatars</a>. Now it's available on <a href='https://github.com/sfi0zy/ucavatar'>GitHub</a> and <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/ucavatar'>NPM</a> as a little standalone library called Ucavatar.
