As you possibly know, I have mental problems. In particular, some my emotions were gone. I must observe other people a lot to copy their behavior and integrate myself into society. I did it for years and I got a system of human behavior in my head. I thought it's time to make a book about it and the book has been printed. It's called "The pyramid of adaptation" ("Пирамида адаптации" in Russian). The PDF version of the first edition in Russian will be distributed for free for non-commercial purposes and you can <a href='/files/И.%20А.%20Богачев%20-%20Пирамида%20адаптации%20(2019).pdf'>download it here</a>.
