Received a new badge from GitHub and figured out that I'm the Arctic Code Vault Contributor now. Wow! It's interesting, but... Sometimes I'm ashamed of the code I wrote a year ago and now my sources will be saved for 1000 years. Oops. Anyway, the ideas and the project itself are impressive. Now I'm waiting for the same archive program for CodePen.
