SVG paths have an option called stroke-dashoffset and We can animate it. When Chris Coyier posted an article about it, someone said "as always, using properties for effects they were never intended for". He is absolutely right, but...

<p data-height="409" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="JOrGjX" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="sfi0zy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Magic sphere" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/sfi0zy/pen/JOrGjX/">Magic sphere</a> by Ivan Bogachev (<a href="https://codepen.io/sfi0zy">@sfi0zy</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

This propery allows us to add various interesting effects to our websites. For example I created an animation based on the random path, a number of gradients and CSS keyframes. I called it "magic sphere", but it also looks like a Christmas tree joy.
