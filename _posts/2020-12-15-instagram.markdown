Last months I spent a lot of time at home. It's not bad though, but my research slowed down. I need to freshen up. But we have a big problem nowadays - all interesting places are still closed or restricted, and it looks like the lockdown will be prolonged for months. I find a way out - photography. It's a reason for me to go for a walk. I don't need to wear a mask everywhere on the street, and it helps to get new impressions. Also, I started to fill up <a href='https://www.instagram.com/sfi0zy/'>my Instagram profile</a> with a new photos from my small "travels" around Moscow and I want to share them with you.
