Several years ago I created <a href='https://github.com/sfi0zy/ucavatar'>Ucavatar</a>. It's a simple tool, its only purpose is to create geometric patterns on a canvas for future usage as avatars. But it's boring. I have been thinking for a while about the similar tool, but with funny faces, and now I found time for making it. Check it out on CodePen and feel free to use it in your projects.
