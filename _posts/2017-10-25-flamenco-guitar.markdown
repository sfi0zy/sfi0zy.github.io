My flamenco guitar method is now available for sale on <a href='https://editus.ru/more.php?itemid=213'>Editus.ru</a>. It is a book for beginner guitarists which consists of descriptions of the most popular flamenco forms, rhythms and a lot of examples.


I tried to systematize the information about the 12 popular traditional flamenco forms (they are sevillanas, soleares, farruca, alegrias, fandangos, seguiriyas, malaguenas, bulerias, tangos, tarantos, rumba gitana and granadinas) and tell about them in simple words. The book is in Russian (<i class='-grey-4'>Богачев И.А. Гитара фламенко. - М.: Эдитус, 2017</i>), because this is my native language and I can confidently use it in such a difficult situation as teaching. I've prepared a little PDF preview of the book and you can <a href='/files/И. А. Богачев - Гитара фламенко (стр 15-17).pdf'>download it for free</a>.
