A few days ago I published a little bit provocative <a href='https://habr.com/ru/post/495366/'>article about the types of programmers</a>. It looks funny, I used comic faces and some humor, but it's very serious, actually. I drew people's attention to the problem of the team management when the team includes developers with different psychological profiles. The thing is that when we make wrong choices and put people in situations which contradict with their beliefs or habitual models of behavior, their productivity becomes greatly reduced. They work slowly, they lose their energy, they make a lot of mistakes and increase the time of the development of the product. On the other side, when we let the people with specific pairs of behaviors work together, their productivity grows up. I wanted to ask people to share their experience on this subject, and shared <a href='/publications/the-pyramid-of-adaptation'>my own book about human behavior</a> to them. Unfortunately, the audience didn't understand the purpose of the article. But despite this, I think that this publication and the question I asked are very important. Maybe I just asked it in the wrong place...
