I've written an article on habrahabr.ru about one of my experiments. I created a website that can be viewed using a Google Cardboard (or similar devices). The experiment works only in desktop browsers due to bad support of detection of device orientation in mobile browsers for today, but it can be a starting point for the future experiments.
