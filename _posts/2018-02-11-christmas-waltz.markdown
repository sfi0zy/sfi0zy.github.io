The winter is ending, but I'd like to present the Christmas waltz that I wrote a couple of days ago. This is a short, festive waltz for a chamber orchestra. I composed it for piano and it was a common etude for beginners. Later, when I tried to use synthesized strings and a glockenspiel, it was transformed into the beautiful composition. I like it and I think it can create a festive mood.
