I published <a href='https://habr.com/ru/post/518006/'>the first lecture</a> in the series of lectures on mathematics for UI developers. This subject is not the most important thing for our job, and a lot of programmers didn't learn it even in school, but if you create custom projects with WebGL or animations, you need it. I don't know when I'll publish the rest of the articles in this series, it requires a lot of time to convert them into the text format, but I hope I complete the set in this year. Also, I pushed the scripts for generating the slides in the style of the school deck to <a href='https://github.com/sfi0zy/math-slides'>the GitHub repository</a>. Feel free to use them for your lectures too.
