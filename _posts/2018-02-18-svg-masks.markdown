I wrote an article about SVG masks. This is the continuation of the <a href='/publications/particles-animations'>previous article</a>. It was about particles. Today I explained the basic principles of usage of masks and showed three cool examples. As always, they are available on CodePen. The article is in Russian and has been <a href='https://habrahabr.ru/post/349362/'>published on habrahabr.ru</a>.
