I returned to playing electric guitar recently and this is a good reason to share some <a href='https://github.com/sfi0zy/guitarix-presets-collection'>presets for guitarix</a> I created. The first bank in the collection includes the emulation of the Fender '65 Deluxe Reverb combo with a Cry Baby, Tube Screamer and Digital Delay. I created the presets in this bank using my Jagmaster with vintage humbuckers and they give a very nice sound for it. If you're looking for an example of presets for guitarix - just check out them.
