Nick Babich writes very interesting articles on UX Planet and usually they include amazing animations. But it seems like they are created using After Effects or similar program. I got the idea from <a href='https://uxplanet.org/microinteractions-the-secret-to-great-app-design-4cfe70fbaccf'>this article</a> and tried to create the animation of the funny face using CSS and JS.
