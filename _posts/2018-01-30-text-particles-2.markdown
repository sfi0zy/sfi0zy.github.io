Previously I created a <a href='https://sfi0zy.github.io/codepen/text-particles'>nice animation for the "404" page</a>. The main idea of the animation was successful and I used it several times with small changes. One of these variants has been published on CodePen and I'd like to share it here too. I fixed the bug with opacity in Safari (it's like the old IE requires personal approach) and both animations work in all modern browsers now. As always they are free to use.
