<a href='https://sfi0zy.github.io/muilessium/'>Muilessium</a> is my pet project. For a long three years I used it for my experiments. I tried different methodologies, different tools and languages. I tested a lot of ideas and got a lot of experience. I was looking for a small, but powerful tool for structuring code in landings, personal websites, blogs and other simple websites. Usually their code is awful. Today I released Muilessium v1.0. I think it can be useful for someone else. Anyway, it's time to create a stable version and make a little break.
