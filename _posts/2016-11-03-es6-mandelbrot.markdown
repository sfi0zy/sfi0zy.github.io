This is one of my first projects. Initially I wrote explorer of the Mandelbrot set in C++ in 2012, but several years later I have wrote it again but in Javascript. It was an experiment of usage of typed arrays in JS. This explorer allows you to move and to zoom image with your mouse or keyboard and to save current state on your computer.
