Woohoo! I wrote 1000 answers to questions on <a href='https://qna.habr.com/user/sfi0zy'>qna.habr.com</a> (ex. toster.ru, the Russian alternative to StackOverflow). I don’t know, if it’s a lot or a little, but these answers helped me to learn, how to explain things in simple words, and they made me a reputation as a programmer. I think the 1000th answer is a good anniversary to celebrate!
