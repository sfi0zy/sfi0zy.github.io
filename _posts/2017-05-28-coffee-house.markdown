So.. This is another HTML template created using Muilessium framework. Today it's a template for the coffee house in Moscow (all names and addresses are random - it's just a template). Check out it on <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/53159669/Coffee-house'>Behance</a>.

UPD: This template was created using Muilessium v0.1.24. It has been deprecated and the demo has been removed.
