I used PostCSS for a long time. In the <a href='https://habr.com/ru/post/457340/'>new article</a> I created a compilation of the best PostCSS plugins in my opinion. They can save a lot of time while developing, but I often see programmers which don't know about them. It's strange. I wrote this article to show when we can use these plugins. I think every developer should try to do it.
