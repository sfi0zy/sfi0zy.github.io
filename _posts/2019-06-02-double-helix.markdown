A few days ago I played with different LESS mixins. It was boring a little and I've added some keyframes to my demo and got this nice animation. It was a Sunday, I wasn't concentrated and made a couple of stupid mistakes in the code. Its performance can be improved, I know. Ana Tudor fixed them and created an alternative version of the animation. It doesn't work in IE/Edge, but it's very interesting. I like it.
