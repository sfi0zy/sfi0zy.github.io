I published an <a href='https://habrahabr.ru/post/349988/'>article about dotted lines</a>. This is the fourth article about animations in interfaces. Enjoy it!


UPD: The translation of the article is <a href='https://habrahabr.info/development/website-development/66-dotted-wow-effects-about-magic-in-simple-words.html'>available on habrahabr.info</a>. Some examples are not included in the translation (maybe it's a bug), but they are still available in the original article.
