I didn't participate in challenges for programmers for a long time, but yesterday I decided to take part in the current weekly #codepenchallenge. It's called "B and W and A". What is the best thing to do with the letter "A"? Of course, construct snowflakes. So, I did it. This pen reminded me of those times when I created things just for fun. It's easy for me to write examples like this snowfall nowadays, but there were times when I thought that this is kind of magical. Anyway, this animation is nice. Check out it on CodePen!
