Today I would like to present my <a href='https://habr.com/ru/post/479580/'>new article about Golden Canon grid</a>. It's not about the golden ratio, not about the history of book printing, but about websites. The modern CSS gives us a possibility to work with such grids without pain. CSS grid layout is the very powerful tool in this case. I explained how to use it when building promotional websites.
