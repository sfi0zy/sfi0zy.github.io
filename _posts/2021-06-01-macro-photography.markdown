I don't like insects. I never liked them. But during this spring I made some photos of insects, spiders and other small creatures. It was an experiment with extension tubes and my old Helios 44m4, but it looks like this kind of photos is interesting for other people. So I think I'll continue to shoot insects from time to time. Follow <a href='https://www.instagram.com/sfi0zy/'>me on Instagram</a> to see more interesting stuff that I'll find in the parks of Moscow.
