Summer is a good time to learn something new. Especially if the all interesting places are under quarantine. Sometimes learning can be hard. It happens if you are trying to dive into a new subject without any preparation. The better idea is to learn subjects, which are connected somehow to the skills you already have. So, I created a skills map for myself. I never thought that all things I'm interested in are connected, but they are. Now I see where I have possibilities to improve myself and open new opportunities. I highly recommend to do the same thing for everyone.
