Three years ago I switched to front-end development and started learning HTML and CSS. Up to this day I shared interesting examples on CodePen. Not every day, of course, but often. Several days ago their number reached 300. Looking back, I can say that it was a good time. Painting with CSS, canvas animations and WebGL shaders, SVG hacks... There are no impossible design ideas for me now. I can create everything, it's only a matter of time. I think it's a good idea to celebrate this anniversary.
