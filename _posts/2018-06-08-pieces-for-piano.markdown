My new book has been published this week. This is a collection of easy pieces for piano those I wrote last year.

The free preview is <a href='/files/И. А. Богачев - Нотная тетрадь №1 (стр 11 15 28 42 77).pdf'>available here</a>, but I'm not selling it like my previous book (it was about <a href='https://sfi0zy.github.io/other/flamenco-guitar'>flamenco guitar</a>). If you are living in Moscow, interested in my music and want to get one book, you can contact me via email.
