I received an interesting question recently. Another developer asked about horizontal scroll and different effects attached to it. He shows me a video concept of some gallery and I thought that it's worth it to create an example of something similar. So I did it. It looks like Locomotive Scroll works strange in the CodePen`s iframes, sometimes it stucks, but it's expected. Iframes and custom scroll have always been a bad combination. But the whole demo is pretty nice in my opinion. Feel free to open it on CodePen and use it for your experiments too.
