5 years ago I switched from C/C++ and programming in \*nix environments to Javascript and became a frontend developer. And now, looking back, I can say these were interesting years. I learned a lot, I have grown from a kid, who didn't know how to write basic HTML layout, to a professional in creative frontend. From the first days I wanted to make beautiful things, not only UI, but animations, complex designs, 3D presentations e.t.c. Later, I started teaching to understand things in computer graphics and math in a more serious way. My first demos on CodePen look awkward now, but they were pretty cool then. Five years ago people didn't know the tricks, how to create such things. It's funny, but I can say "I was painting in CSS before it became mainstream" and it'll be completely true. Anyway, It's a good point to take a little break and then return to frontend with new ideas.
