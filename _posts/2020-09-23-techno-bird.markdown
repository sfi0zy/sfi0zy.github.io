In the latest article I explained how to use matrices for making 3D scenes. A couple of days later I thought it'll be a good idea to create an additional interactive demo for my students. And there it is. I don't know if this thing has its own name in programming or mathematics, but I call it "techno bird". This variation of it is written in VanillaJS and GLSL and work in all modern browsers. At least it should, I haven't tested it really. But its main purpose is to illustrate the principles from my article, so if it works in Chrome - it's enough. Check out this demo on CodePen and follow me to not miss the future updates!
