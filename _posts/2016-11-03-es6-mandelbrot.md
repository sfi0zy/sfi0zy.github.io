This is the one of my first projects. Initially I wrote explorer of the Mandelbrot set in C++ in 2012, but several years later I wrote it again but using javascript. This was an experiment of using typed arrays in javascript. This explorer allows You to move and zoom image with Your mouse or keyboard and save current state to Your computer.
