For a long time I wanted to made an experiment. I have an idea to combine Delaunay triangulation, clip-path, and my CSS demos with multiple backgrounds. Finally, I found a time to make it. The performance of this combination is not good, but it was expected. Clip-path property seems very heavy in terms of performance optimization. But the animation I got can be used for small pictures. It works well enough. Feel free to add it to your projects and share it with your co-workers if you like it.
