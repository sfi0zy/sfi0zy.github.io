I just released the <a href='https://github.com/sfi0zy/promo-core'>PromoCore</a> v1.0.0. It's a boilerplate for static promotional websites. Pug, LESS, PostCSS, Babel, linters, docs, detailed logs, etc. Everything you need to start a project is here. And the structure of the project is included too. Events manager, files structure and factory for components, singletons and wrappers for dependencies and polyfills, flags for features, etc. I tried to get all my experience in creative front-end development and create the one boilerplate to rule them all. I included the things, which I always use, and I don't included old tricks for IE and awkward HTML templates for SEO. Just the core of the website. Feel free to use it for your projects or just for inspiration.
