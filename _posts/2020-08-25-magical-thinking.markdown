I published <a href='https://medium.com/@sfi0zy/%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D1%8B%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8-%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5-31641de62b64'>an article about magical thinking</a> in my blog on Medium. It’s in Russian and it contains my personal observations and thoughts from other people with schizotypal disorder from countries of the former USSR. The information in the article shouldn’t be generalized for all patients with the same disorder or for people outside this region, but it’s still can be useful for psychologists.
